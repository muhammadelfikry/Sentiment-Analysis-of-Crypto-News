2024-05-08,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin continues to struggle under bearish control despite a recent rebound, facing multiple resistance levels and high market risk. The cryptocurrency saw its value increase over the weekend due to a weakening dollar, but the overall market sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin recently tested the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a significant technical threshold, which is proving to be a tough barrier. There is a possibility that Bitcoin may not break through this resistance. If it holds, Bitcoin could retest the $58,000 mark, a strong support level in recent months. The 100-day EMA is also around $60,000, reinforcing this critical price zone. The trading volume is somewhat neutral with a slight downward trend, not indicating a bullish reversal is on the horizon. This aligns with the broader market sentiment, as various risk indicators continue to suggest heightened caution. Liquidation of long positions has also been observed, slowing the momentum in perpetual markets. As this consolidation phase continues, Bitcoin enthusiasts and traders are closely watching to see if Bitcoin can break through the $65,000 resistance level. Such a move could potentially reenergize market sentiment and pave the way towards $70,000. However, the overall narrative remains bearish. Bitcoin's inability to break through key EMAs such as the 26 and 50, along with ongoing high-risk signals from market indicators, suggest that bears currently dominate. Observers are now waiting to see if Bitcoin can maintain its position above the $60,000 mark or if it will succumb to another round of sell-offs, confirming the bearish trend.","Bitcoin is struggling to break through the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

2024-05-08,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the former Chief Security Officer at Blockstream and current CEO at Bitcoin-focused Jan3, has predicted a surge in Bitcoin's price towards a new historic peak. Mow, known for using metaphors from 'The Matrix' movie in his discussions about Bitcoin, recently tweeted his expectation for the world's leading cryptocurrency to reach a new all-time high soon. The previous all-time high was achieved in March when Bitcoin soared to $73,750. Over the past weekend, Bitcoin's price saw a significant increase, rising by over 10%. On Monday, Bitcoin reached $65,180, driven by the Grayscale spot ETF's first inflow of $63 million on Friday. This was the first positive flow for this spot Bitcoin ETF since its approval by the SEC in mid-January. Before this inflow, GBTC had regularly seen investors withdrawing funds, approximately $26 billion in total, primarily due to Grayscale's fees being much higher than other spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin initially dropped 3% but has since recovered 1.70%, trading at the $62,285 level. Mow made another bullish statement on Bitcoin on Monday, tweeting that money under others' control 'will inevitably cease to be money...Money can only exist without degradation so long as it is bearer. #Bitcoin.' Mow believes that Bitcoin will eventually reach an astounding price level of $1 million, following the appearance of 'Omega candles' on the charts. On Sunday, Mow tweeted that 'the monetary dark ages ended on January 3, 2009,' referring to the launch of Bitcoin by its enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. January 3 is often referred to as Bitcoin Day, marking the genesis of BTC. The launch of Bitcoin was a response to the economic instability caused by fractional reserve banking.","According to U.S. Mow, the former Chief Security Officer at Blockstream and current CEO at Bitcoin-focused Jan3, Bitcoin is going to reach a new all-time high of $1 million.

2024-05-08,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has highlighted a significant trend in the Bitcoin market, a surge in buying activity by high-net-worth holders. Over the past two months, these individuals or entities, also known as 'whales' within the crypto community, have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin at unprecedented levels. The buying spree has been occurring while Bitcoin prices have been ranging between $60,000 to $70,000. These high-net-worth holders possess between 100 and 1000 BTC, equating to roughly $6.5 million - $65 million of Bitcoin. This aggressive buying behavior raises questions about whether these whales have insights that the rest of the market does not. One possible explanation for this surge in activity could be their anticipation of a forthcoming bullish trend on the Bitcoin market. With institutional adoption on the rise, these whales may be positioning themselves ahead of a potential price rally, believing that current levels are an ideal entry point for accumulation. However, the specific motivations for the whales' buying frenzy remain unknown. Data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals that Bitcoin whales, or addresses with more than 1,000 BTC, have accumulated significantly in recent months, particularly during price dips. The firm has noticed a trend of dip buying among Bitcoin whales, albeit with waning conviction. 'Whales are buying the dip, but is their conviction dwindling? Addresses holding over 1000 BTC have accumulated strongly in recent months, especially during dips,' IntoTheBlock observed, adding that prices have risen shortly after each accumulation. However, a falling accumulation trend has been noted among these large Bitcoin holders, with each surge in accumulation less than the previous one. This could indicate that whales have less and less appetite to buy the dip. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 1.60% in the last 24 hours to $63,003.","High-net-worth Bitcoin holders have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin at unprecedented levels over the past two months.

2024-05-08,"According to U.Today, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor continues to express bullish optimism despite the recent fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin's price has seen mixed movements, falling from $65,500 to $62,830 on Monday, then rebounding to $63,600 today. However, the broader trend on the daily chart is concerning, with Bitcoin registering another lower high since mid-March, which has increased anxiety following a recent lower low. In trading terminology, a 'lower high' is when the peak price of an asset is lower than the previous high, indicating a potential downward trend. A 'lower low' signifies a new trough lower than the previous low, suggesting further declines. Despite these concerning signals, Saylor remains steadfast in his bullish stance. In his latest communication, he encourages investors to 'Run with the Bulls,' offering reassurance to those uncertain about the cryptocurrency's future prospects. However, cautionary tones persist, reminding investors that Saylor's optimism does not guarantee stability. The fate of Bitcoin depends on the actions of buyers, with the potential for a collapse looming if their support falters. Analysts warn that if bearish sentiment prevails, Bitcoin could revisit key support levels at $61,000 and the $56,000 range, where significant liquidity is concentrated.","Bitcoin's price has fluctuated between $65,500 to $62,830 on Monday and $63,600 today.

2024-05-07,"According to U.Today, venture investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, also known as Pomp, recently appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box show to discuss the factors driving Bitcoin's recent price surge. Despite daily volatility, Bitcoin has been on a steady growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, according to Pompliano. Pompliano noted that the price action around the recent halving has been unfolding as expected. Historically, Bitcoin's price increases by about 19% a month before a halving, and by 1-2% in the month following the event. This pattern is currently being observed, he said. Since last Friday, Bitcoin has seen a more than 10% increase. Pompliano attributed this surge to Grayscale’s GBTC ETF, which saw a $63 million inflow for the first time since January, after four months of consistent outflows. This is the largest Bitcoin ETF, and the inflows have stimulated the price rise, he explained. Another significant factor mentioned by Pompliano is the 200-day moving average for Bitcoin reaching an all-time high, surpassing $50,000 for the first time.

He referred to this day as the end of the 'monetary dark ages'. January 3 is recognized as Bitcoin Day as it is the timestamp for the Bitcoin genesis date, as reported in a Times article. The article also discussed the economic instability caused by fractional reserve banking. Interestingly, Mow's company name, Jan3, mirrors the date of Bitcoin Day. The years 2008 and 2009 were marked by the mortgage bonds crisis, which is thought to have motivated Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. In response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve began printing additional U.S. dollars and injecting them into the economy, a process known as quantitative easing. Nakamoto launched Bitcoin in 2009 and then abruptly left the project in the hands of developers the following year to pursue other ventures.

2024-05-05,"According to Cointelegraph: As per crypto traders, Bitcoin could see a significant bullish trend reversal soon, given the appearance of a certain trading pattern. A bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern has been sighted, which, if confirmed, could “propel the next leg up” for Bitcoin. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland explained in a recent post, ""If we don't break straight through $67.5k then something like this forming over the next month would make sense for a bottom pattern reversal.” He added, “It would be a great setup to propel the next leg up,” referring to the inverse head and shoulders pattern. This pattern symbolizes a easing downtrend and suggests buyers are growing more dominant. However, a critical condition for this trend to materialize is that Bitcoin must maintain its price above the short-term holder price of $59,500, emphasized pseudonymous crypto analyst and CMCC Crest co-founder, Willy Woo. According to the pattern, Bitcoin’s price will form three troughs below a certain ""neckline"" resistance, with the middle trough, or the “head”, lower than the left and right ""shoulders"". Bitcoin’s price rebounded slightly from this ""head"" at $58,614 on May 1. If the pattern continues, it would settle around a second ""shoulder"" at around $60,000, a significant support level. Hyland's model even suggests that Bitcoin could surpass its current all-time high of $73,800 by June. Also, the Fear and Greed Index, a measure of buyer interest in the crypto market, is gradually reflecting an uptick in sentiment. Despite the positive signs, some traders expect Bitcoin's price to remain relatively stable in the near term; however, they do not necessarily see this as a bearish signal.","Bitcoin could see a significant bullish trend reversal soon.

2024-05-05,"According to U.Today, a live debate on YouTube, organized by ZeroHedge, saw billionaire investor Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital and top analyst Peter Schiff discuss the role of Bitcoin (BTC) and gold as inflation hedges. They were joined by Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeSchift, and Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at NYU. Peter Schiff, a critic of Bitcoin, initiated the debate by arguing that Bitcoin, originally created as a digital currency, fails to function effectively due to its slow and expensive nature. Schiff believes that Bitcoin proponents are trying to reposition it as a digital version of gold, but it falls short of gold's intrinsic value derived from its physical properties. He emphasized gold's tangible utility in industries like jewelry and electronics, contrasting it with Bitcoin, which he believes lacks practical uses and utility. Schiff asserted that gold retains its intrinsic properties over time, serving as a genuine store of value. He also argued that the perceived value of Bitcoin is merely based on speculative demand and does not reflect any inherent usefulness or practical applications. In response, Scaramucci countered Schiff's argument by highlighting that only 5% of gold's value is derived from manufacturing purposes, with the majority attributed to its acceptance as a store of value. He emphasized that Bitcoin, like gold, has a deflationary aspect due to its fixed supply. Scaramucci views Bitcoin as 'digital gold,' noting its portability compared to physical gold. He also pointed out that Bitcoin is following an adoption curve that will impact its value over decades, likening it to the trajectory of tech stocks that became standard over time and contributed to the S&P 500 index. In other news, cryptocurrencies rebounded on Friday, driven by a rise in Bitcoin's (BTC) price, raising optimism that the recent drawdown may be subsiding.

Farside Investors reported that on Friday, May 2, a net $63 million was added to the trust. GBTC has been a favored financial tool for investing in Bitcoin (BTC) without directly buying the cryptocurrency. However, it faced heightened competition in January when it was converted into an easier-to-trade ETF, coinciding with the introduction of nine competing spot Bitcoin ETFs. Due to its relatively higher fees, investors pulled billions of dollars from GBTC, resulting in a streak of 78 consecutive days of outflows that ended last Friday. Currently, GBTC holds $18.1 billion in assets, a decrease from over $26 billion previously. In contrast, IBIT, which now ranks second, started from zero in January and currently holds $16.9 billion.

He stated that there has never been and may never be another market like Bitcoin.

In a blog post, Brandt highlighted the uniqueness of the Bitcoin market. He described altcoins and meme coins as 'proliferations' that owe their existence to Bitcoin. He outlined several factors that make Bitcoin unique, including its non-hackable nature, limited quantity, global acceptance, trackability, and almost instant transactional capability. He also noted Bitcoin's price behavior as a significant factor, stating that Bitcoin is 'an attempted hostile takeover of the world’s currency system'. Brandt also pointed out that Bitcoin's price advances have often been parabolic in nature.

2024-05-04,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price, which recently dipped, has started to recover, sparking speculation about a potential rally in May. Despite a promising start to the year and a surge to an all-time high price in March, Bitcoin's progress stalled in April. The primary cryptocurrency began May on a shaky note, declining to $56,800, the lowest level in nearly two months. However, the last few days have been slightly more optimistic, with Bitcoin reclaiming some lost ground and briefly spiking towards the $60,000 mark. ChatGPT, a popular AI-powered chatbot, was asked about the possibility of a more substantial rally and a new all-time high for Bitcoin this month. While the chatbot did not rule out the possibility, it outlined several factors that need to occur for such a price expansion. Favorable regulatory news was mentioned as a top contributing element. The approval of additional ETFs could result in a resurgence, according to ChatGPT. Another regulatory development that could positively impact the entire cryptocurrency market is a decisive victory for Ripple in its legal battle against the SEC. The second most important factor named by ChatGPT is institutional adoption. Increased adoption by large institutions, such as investment funds, banks, or corporations, can lead to significant inflows of capital into Bitcoin. Technological advancements, market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and supply dynamics were also added to the list of essential elements. Multiple indicators suggest that Bitcoin's correction might not last long. One example is the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric, which has been experiencing a downfall since the beginning of April. A score above 3.5 suggests that the Bitcoin price is close to its peak, whereas a result below 1 warns about a bottom. The MVRV ratio plunged to 1.87 on May 2, flashing the buy signal for the asset. Another sign is the Bitcoin exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the past two weeks. Shifting from centralized platforms to self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. The halving that took place last month, following which the miners’ rewards for validating blocks on the blockchain were slashed in half, has historically been a precursor of a major revival of the entire crypto sector.","Bitcoin's price has started to recover and briefly spiked towards the $60,000 mark in May.

Dorsey explained that bitcoin is the only viable candidate for a decentralized open protocol for money, which he believes the world needs. He further stated that bitcoin would eventually become the native currency of the internet, eliminating the need for hundreds of payment schemes and intermediaries.

2024-05-03,"According to U.Today, a sequence of numbers tweeted by Elon Musk in June 2021 has been interpreted by some as potential Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Archive, a notable user on the X platform, suggested that Musk's sequence of numbers accurately predicted three Bitcoin price movements. The sequence was tweeted in response to a comment by Dogecoin developer Michi Lumin, who suggested that tweeting vague and cryptic messages could lead to them being interpreted as meaningful and mysterious. The sequence of numbers tweeted by Musk has been scrutinized by crypto enthusiasts, with some suggesting that they could represent future Bitcoin prices. For instance, Benjamin Cowen, a prominent crypto trader, humorously asked if Musk's sequence represented his Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Archive claimed that Musk's sequence coincided with three accurate Bitcoin price movements. The sequence of numbers tweeted by Musk was examined to see if they matched any Bitcoin prices reached after his tweet. For example, Bitcoin reached $61,000 in March 2021, surged to $69,000 in November 2021, and dropped slightly below $20,000 in July 2022. In March 2024, Bitcoin soared to a historic peak close to $74,000 and then fell back close to $65,000 in late April of the same year. Some of the numbers in Musk's sequence appear to coincide with these Bitcoin price movements. However, it is important to note that these correlations are likely coincidental. While Musk is known for his business acumen, it is unlikely that he can accurately predict Bitcoin prices. The similarities between Musk's number sequence and Bitcoin's price movements are most likely a curious coincidence rather than a result of intentional prediction.","The sequence of numbers tweeted by Elon Musk in June 2021 has been interpreted by some as potential Bitcoin price predictions.

2024-05-03,"According to U.Today, nine Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have significantly reduced their holdings by a total of 8,107 BTC, equivalent to approximately $478.22 million. Prominent entities such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have reduced their holdings by 638 BTC ($37.62 million), 3,323 BTC ($196 million), and 1,588 BTC ($93.66 million), respectively. This substantial decrease in Bitcoin holdings by ETFs coincides with the cryptocurrency's price drop below the $60,000 mark, a critical support level that had previously been considered a strong threshold that held the market together. This price decline has led to significant outflows, indicating a shift in investor sentiment toward caution due to increased market volatility and potential risk aversion. Bitcoin has struggled to maintain levels above $60,000 and faced resistance near $61,018. After the drop, the price found temporary footing around $52,107, suggesting a possible new lower boundary of support. Currently, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $59,375, trying to recover from recent falls but still below the critical resistance level. For Bitcoin's price to exhibit growth and regain confidence among investors, it would need to consistently hold above the $52,107 support level and ideally break through the resistance at $61,018. This movement would likely require positive sentiment across the market, possibly driven by rising demand for risky assets. Looking ahead, the key for Bitcoin will be its ability to stabilize and attract investors back to a bullish stance. If it successfully maintains above the mentioned support and breaks past the resistance, it could signal a turnaround to a bullish market. However, failure to do so might see the price testing even lower support levels, possibly around $50,000.","Nine Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds have significantly reduced their Bitcoin holdings by 8,107 BTC, equivalent to approximately $478.22 million.

2024-05-03,"According to U.Today, US banking giant JPMorgan has continued to express caution towards cryptocurrencies, as per their latest report released on April 23. The report suggests that the cryptocurrency market is currently facing a dearth of bullish catalysts, following a significant reduction in ETF inflows. The bank's analysts have identified high positioning, disappointing venture capital funding, and current production costs as the primary bearish catalysts contributing to the ongoing selling pressure. In the previous month, JPMorgan had suggested that the Bitcoin halving was already factored into the price, thus dampening some optimistic predictions. In February, the bank had predicted that the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, could plummet to as low as $42,000 following the halving event. It was also forecasted that the production cost of a single coin could approximately double. During the same period, Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz had also cautioned that the Bitcoin market was becoming overheated. Bitcoin's price had soared to an all-time high of $73,737 in March, recording eight consecutive months of gains. However, it underwent a significant correction in April and continued to decline in May due to disastrous ETF outflows and macroeconomic concerns. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $59,110. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his long-standing criticism of Bitcoin, labeling it as a 'fraud' and a 'Ponzi scheme.' He also predicted that Bitcoin would not make significant progress as a currency.

2024-05-03,"According to U.Today, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has seen a significant drop, leading to panic in the spot Bitcoin ETFs segment. Analysts are questioning the rationality of this panic-selling. Qiao Wang, a seasoned cryptocurrency investor and cofounder of Messari, has referred to the May 1 session as the 'worst day by far' for exchange-traded funds based on spot Bitcoin (BTC). During this session, the net volume of funds in BTC ETFs lost $500 million. Fidelity Investments’ Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) accounted for the largest part of this loss, being down by $191 million. Meanwhile, products from Grayscale and ARK combined cover over 50% of the half-billion losses. Wang agreed with his colleague Jim Bianco's observation of a large percentage of 'paper hands' among the first generation of Bitcoin spot ETF holders. The Bitcoin ETFs segment also experienced three difficult trading days on April 24, 25, and 30, with the May 1 session marking the sixth consecutive 'red' day for Bitcoin ETFs. Previously, spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in Hong Kong, ending their first day of trading with a mediocre AUM of $140 million and a trading volume of $12.1 million in equivalent. Despite the current market conditions, Wang remains moderately optimistic about the future generations of Bitcoin Spot ETFs purchasers. He believes that more 'diamond hand' institutions will enter the scene, stating that heavyweight asset managers just 'need time to get comfortable'. Following the Bitcoin (BTC) price drop below $57,000, almost $600 million in liquidated long positions were registered over the last two days, according to CoinGlass data.","The Bitcoin (BTC) price has seen a significant drop, leading to panic in the spot Bitcoin ETFs segment.

2024-05-03,"According to U.Today, a detailed analysis of on-chain metrics suggests a possible robust recovery for Bitcoin, following its fall below $60,000. The 'Bitcoin Fundamental Index' by Swissblock, a combined measure of various Bitcoin network health indicators, recently reached what seems to be a turning point, indicating a potential rise in Bitcoin's price. A key metric to note is the Short-Term Holder MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which is currently at 0.96. This ratio essentially compares the market value (the current trading price of Bitcoin) to the realized value (the average price at which coins were last moved). A value below one usually indicates that short-term holders are holding coins at a loss, which can signal a potential bottom if other conditions align. Historically, when the STH-MVRV has fallen below one, it has often been a precursor to a market recovery. This suggests that the selling pressure from short-term holders is decreasing and could indicate that sellers are exhausted. This exhaustion is further supported by the recent performance of the Bitcoin Fundamental Index, which shows a recovery from lower levels, indicating increased network growth and investor confidence. The 'Bitcoin Fundamental Index' chart shows significant spikes in the index correlating closely with increases in Bitcoin's price. The index measures several aspects of network health, including transaction volume, wallet activity and other undisclosed proprietary indicators that aim to gauge the overall sentiment and fundamental strength of Bitcoin. The current index value is nearing the higher end of its recent range. Historically, such patterns have indicated strong bullish sentiment building up, especially when combined with a low STH-MVRV.","The Bitcoin Fundamental Index by Swissblock suggests a potential rise in Bitcoin's price.

2024-05-02,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin has slipped below the significant $60,000 mark, causing concern among investors and market analysts. This drop could indicate the end of the current bull run, as the 100-day Exponential Moving Average is on the brink of falling. If this level breaks, it could mark the end of the bullish trend that has pushed Bitcoin to recent highs. This would not just be a setback, but a fundamental shift in market sentiment. The increase in trading volume, indicating a rise in selling pressure, further fuels these concerns. More traders are moving to offload their holdings, either in anticipation of lower prices or to cut their losses, adding to the downward pressure on Bitcoin.

Following Bitcoin's recent 9% price drop, Brandt's analysis indicates a scenario where the leading cryptocurrency could dip into the high $40,000s before resuming its bullish trajectory. This assessment comes amidst increasing uncertainty after Bitcoin's significant loss since the start of the week, marking its largest drop of the year. Prices have plummeted from $64,700 to $57,400, causing market participants to be gripped by panic and doubt about the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

He points out a key observation: despite past halving events and the launch of ETFs, Bitcoin has failed to surpass its highs from three years ago. This insight emphasizes the need to resolve current market dynamics, especially as Bitcoin struggles to maintain its upward momentum. Despite acknowledging a 25% probability that Bitcoin had already reached its local peak at $74,000, Brandt remains cautiously optimistic about the ongoing bull market. However, he suggests that corrections may accompany this upward trend, with the potential for the Bitcoin price to correct by more than 25% from current levels.

2024-05-02,"According to CryptoPotato, the current crypto market cycle, experiencing a significant pullback, is primarily driven by the popularity of meme coins and the excitement surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. Economist and trader Alex Krüger noted that meme coins have dominated the narrative, along with Bitcoin following the ETF launches. Despite many of these coins dumping or going to zero, and scams being prevalent on the Solana and Base networks, large-cap meme coins remain among the strongest performers of the year. They continue to show significant returns despite the market correction, establishing themselves as a viable asset class. CoinGecko data reveals that the total market capitalization of all meme coins is approximately $46 billion, surpassing the combined value of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). They represent about 2% of the total crypto market. However, Krüger observed a dark side to this trend, as the market began to be flooded with scammy meme coin launches and cash-grabbing founders around February. These founders prioritize quick profit and short-term hype over longevity, causing a division in the crypto community over the value and purpose of meme coins. Crypto market sentiment has declined, with the Bitcoin correction reaching 23% in a dip below $57,000. This pullback was anticipated and could potentially drop as low as 30%. Bitcoin investor 'CRG' remains optimistic, stating that Bitcoin is far from finished and predicts it will exceed $100,000 much sooner than expected.

This purchase has increased the firm's Bitcoin holdings by 25,250 since the end of the fourth quarter. The latest acquisition brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 214,400 BTC, valued at $13.22 billion. The average purchase price was $35,180.

This could change with a new accounting rule that requires digital assets to be valued at market prices. Companies have until 2025 to adopt this revision. In 2020, MicroStrategy became the first public company to buy Bitcoin as a capital allocation strategy, citing the need to hedge against inflation. Despite Saylor's popularity among digital asset advocates, no other U.S. public company, except Tesla and a few crypto-related firms, has chosen to include Bitcoin in its financial statement.

2024-05-01,"According to Bloomberg, signs of stress are becoming evident across spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the cryptocurrency's value declines. Some of the largest ETFs tracking Bitcoin experienced the most significant discounts to the value of underlying assets in their brief history on Tuesday, following a roughly 5% slump in Bitcoin. The downward trend continued on Wednesday, with Bitcoin dropping as much as 5.6%. The $16 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, among others, has been affected by this trend. These discounts may indicate the inherent frictions in overlapping the traditional market with Bitcoin. This is because shares in the funds can only be created and redeemed in exchange for cash rather than 'in-kind' exchanges for Bitcoin itself. However, such price deviations are usually short-lived due to the creation-redemption mechanism of ETFs. Despite this, the discounts highlight how Bitcoin's volatility may pose larger risks to ETF investors than funds focused on traditional financial assets. Concurrently, the volatility creates profitable opportunities for specialized trading firms known as authorized participants, who are responsible for keeping the fund prices in line with their net asset values. Expectations for fund flows were surpassed after the ETFs were launched, breaking multiple records in the more-than $8 trillion US industry.

2024-05-01,"According to U.Today, Peter Schiff, a well-known gold advocate, has once again expressed his pessimistic view on Bitcoin, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency is at a critical juncture. Schiff recently drew attention to Bitcoin's status, suggesting that its fall into what he refers to as the 'danger zone' could be a significant turning point. Bitcoin has indeed breached the $60,000 mark, a level that had served as a robust psychological and technical support during the 2024 bull run. This decline has further intensified negative market sentiment. Schiff believes that dropping below this crucial level could signal the end of the bullish run that has enthralled the market over the past year. Current charts show Bitcoin hovering around $58,540, with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) nearby. Schiff cautions that a prolonged fall below this moving average would confirm the bearish trend, effectively 'ending the rally' and possibly terminating the bull run for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, an increase in trading volume accompanying the price drop indicates increased selling pressure. This surge in volume is typically a bearish indicator, further supporting Schiff's theory that the market is turning. The sentiment among traders is becoming increasingly cautious, with many preparing for further declines. From a technical perspective, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim the $60,000 level, the next major support is at $51,965. This represents a significant pullback from recent highs, and a drop to this level could trigger further selling. On the other hand, a rebound from current levels must overcome resistance at $60,000 to invalidate the bearish scenario. A successful push above this could see Bitcoin attempting to reach higher resistance levels near $64,000, offering a ray of hope for bulls.","Peter Schiff is pessimistic about Bitcoin.

2024-05-01,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Correction: Three Signs Point Towards a Possible Bottom A combination of the Federal Reserve’s recent minutes release, indications of Bitcoin (BTC) miners’ resilience, and a rising demand for stablecoins in China implies that Bitcoin (BTC) may be nearing its price floor. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant price drop between April 30 and May 1, falling by 11.5 % to $56,522. This caused $172 million of leveraged long position liquidations, which stands out as relatively low given the $28.9 billion open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures immediately before the price crash. Market uncertainty is expected to settle following the publication of the Federal Reserve's minutes. Economists and investors are holding their breath as Jerome Powell, the chairperson of the US Federal Reserve, navigates the two-day monetary council meeting. Notwithstanding the expectation that interest rates will remain steady at 5.25%, questions remain about the ability of the U.S. Treasury Department's capacity to finance government expenses. Decreasing value in the Russell 2000 Index coupled with a downturn in WTI oil prices also signifies growing risk-aversion among investors. However, the general outlook for Bitcoin has become more optimistic following robust Q1 corporate earnings. Despite the recent halving of Bitcoin miners' rewards, there's negligible evidence of miner capitulation. This threw into focus the resilience of Bitcoin miners, staying at bay from selling despite a significant drop in the Hashrate Index. An increase in the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly USD Coin (USDC), is another signal for an improving market sentiment. The rising premium for USDC transactions in China exemplifies a robust demand for converting the Chinese yuan into USDC. However, as always, there remains some degree of uncertainty. In the US, for instance, net outflows from US-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million over the past five trading days. All eyes are now turned towards the support level at $56,500, which represents a crucial test for the market's trajectory.","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant price drop between April 30 and May 1, falling by 11.5% to $56,522.

2024-04-30,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin is currently facing a significant challenge: breaking out of its current tight price range. On the daily chart, Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $60,000 and $70,000 marks, struggling to find a definitive direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is around the 50% level, suggests a balance in market momentum. The main question on everyone's mind is whether Bitcoin can maintain its support above $60,000 or if it will succumb to bearish pressure, potentially leading to a drop towards $52,000. While such a drop is possible, analysts believe it to be a less likely scenario given the current market structure. On the other hand, a decisive climb above the $70,000 resistance level could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new highs. However, this move is not without its challenges. With the Bollinger Bands tightening, a significant move may be imminent. Support levels are visible around $60,436, which could act as a potential springboard for a bounce back, while the $70,000 region remains the key resistance to overcome.

He anticipates that the cryptocurrency's price could drop by nearly 50%. Brandt believes there is a 25% chance that the bull market cycle has ended after Bitcoin hit a high of around $73,000 in March. He predicts that Bitcoin's price will fall back to the low of over $30,000 in 2021, a drop of about 50% from the current level. Brandt's argument is based on his concept of 'exponential decay', which suggests that each bull market cycle of Bitcoin from 2009 to 2021 has seen a decrease of about 20% compared to the previous cycle. Based on this, he calculates that the increase in this bull market is expected to be about 4.5 times that of the previous cycle (2018-2021), resulting in a predicted high point of $72,723.

However, recent data reveals a significant drop, with Runes transactions contributing only $1.03 million in fees on April 28. On the day of the halving, April 20, transaction fees within the Bitcoin network saw a notable spike, primarily due to the implementation of the Runes protocol, which led to higher mining fees. Runes transactions accounted for 57.7% of all Bitcoin network transactions, with financial transactions trailing behind at 41.5%. Ordinals and BRC-20 accounted for 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively. This dominance persisted over the halving weekend, with Runes maintaining most of the network activity. On April 21, Runes transactions accounted for 51.6% of total transactions. However, by April 22, this dominance began to decrease, dropping to 42.5%, while Bitcoin financial transactions claimed a larger portion, accounting for 56.5% of total transactions processed that day. The situation has since changed, with transaction fees decreasing. Medium-priority transactions are now priced at approximately $8.48, while high-priority transactions are priced at around $9.321. This marks a 75% decrease in fees compared to the immediate aftermath of the halving, which saw fees rise to $146 for a medium-priority transaction and $170 for a high-priority transaction. Bitcoin researcher Jade Ardinals suggests that the increased load on the network was primarily caused by minting. Speculation surrounding Runes caused a surge in minting activities, creating an 'artificial' strain on Bitcoin block space. Analysts anticipate that this pressure will diminish over time.

2024-04-30,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin miners are experiencing the negative impacts of the recent halving, with industry revenues hitting their lowest since early 2023. This situation has led to tighter profit margins and raised concerns about the survival of certain industry firms during Bitcoin’s next halving epoch. It also brings into question the potential impact on Bitcoin’s market price. Data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s 'Puell Multiple' immediately after the halving between April 19 and April 20. The Puell Multiple is a ratio that compares the value of daily BTC issuance in USD terms to the 365-day moving average of the same metric. With the number of new BTC issued to miners dropping from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block, the Puell multiple has seen a decline. According to Glassnode Academy, a high Puell multiple indicates high miner profitability, incentivizing miners to liquidate their coins. On the other hand, a low multiple forces less competitive miners to shut down their rigs, making the remaining miners more profitable and enabling them to sell fewer coins to cover their operations. As of April 28, the multiple was at 0.73, significantly below its 365-day simple-moving-average of 1.43. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju stated on Twitter that miners now have two options: capitulation or waiting for a rise in Bitcoin price. He added that there are currently no signs of capitulation. CryptoQuant’s mining dashboard indicates that miner BTC flows to OTC desks and exchanges remain relatively low, suggesting that they are not eager to sell their BTC. Despite the suppressed miner revenues, the day of the halving was unusually profitable for miners, generating $106 million in revenue compared to approximately $68 million on previous days. This temporary profit boost was largely due to the simultaneous launch of Runes, a new protocol standard for minting tokens on Bitcoin, developed by Ordinals creator Casey Rordamor. The rush to mint new tokens by Runes users drove Bitcoin network fees to over $100 per transaction, allowing miners to net several blocks with over 30 BTC in fee revenue. However, fees have since returned to normal levels, and miner revenue has dropped to $28.5 million per day.","Bitcoin miners are experiencing the negative impacts of the recent halving.

2024-04-30,"According to CryptoPotato, a griefing attack on the Bitcoin testnet recently led to a significant surge in network activity, generating over 165,000 blocks, equivalent to three years’ worth of blocks, in just one week. The attacker, Jameson Lopp, co-founder and Chief Security Officer of Casa, publicly acknowledged his role in the incident, which sparked criticism from other Bitcoin developers. Lopp defended the attack as a 'trivial exploit' that required only 20 lines of code and cost him just $1 in electricity. He argued that his intent was not malicious but to draw attention to a weakness he had previously identified and felt was not being adequately addressed through conventional communication methods. The attack involved flooding the testnet with excessive transactions, spamming the network, and significantly increasing the workload. This led to a spike in network difficulty and the generation of over 165,000 blocks. Data from mempool.space showed a significant increase in hash rate and difficulty, peaking at 2,315 TH/s on April 19, before returning to normal levels of around 86 TH/s by April 30. Lopp's description of the incident as a 'free stress test' prompted further backlash from the crypto community. He advocated for a reset of Bitcoin’s testnet to address the 'timewarp' vulnerability and restore mining rewards. However, some likened Lopp’s actions to vandalism. Francis Pouliot, for instance, compared it to defecating in a communal jacuzzi to prompt a relocation. He expressed frustration at the incident, stating that it interfered with the tests of open-source Bitcoin application builders and wasted their time. A member of the Bitcoin Talk Thread referred to the controversy as a 'testnet war' and suggested that individuals like Lopp should be banned from participating in Bitcoin’s testnet activities. He labeled Lopp as a potential threat to the overall security of the Bitcoin network.","The attack on the Bitcoin testnet recently led to a significant surge in network activity, generating over 165,000 blocks in just one week.

2024-04-29,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop, falling more than 15% from its mid-March peak to under $62,000 on Monday morning. Analysts from 'Stockmoney Lizards' have noted that despite the halving being over, Bitcoin continues to show a downward trend. They suggest that this is not the end of the bull market, but rather a correction that could potentially push prices back to the $50K range before continuing. They referred to this as a 'triple top' or 'Wyckoff distribution', indicating that Bitcoin is currently in correction mode. The analysts believe that a correction is necessary after half a year of solid gains. Factors such as war, recession fears, inflation, and reduced ETF buying are all contributing to the current market sentiment. They have identified several layers of support at $60K, $56K, and $52K, each one becoming more likely if the one above it is broken. The short-term outlook for May, which is historically a neutral month, is a potential uptrend within the correction range. However, they also warned that any bad news could push the prices towards the $50K range. This week, the Federal Reserve will make its interest rate decision. Given the higher than expected inflation outlook, rates are likely to remain where they are. This could potentially accelerate the market correction and drop Bitcoin below its immediate support level of $60K. Trader 'CrypNuevo' has advised caution for the coming week, stating that they will not be entering it with any open positions. Despite the overall short-term sentiment being gloomy, Glassnode analyst 'Checkmatey' has observed that Bitcoin retail holders, who are often quick to sell at the first sign of a correction, appear to be accumulating once again.

This unexpected turn has softened the anticipated impact of reduced block rewards that follow Bitcoin's halving event. Dune dashboard data shows that fees for minting Runes have surpassed 1,200 BTC. Source: Cryptokoryo Research Greg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, emphasized that while the halving led to an expected decrease in mining revenue due to reduced Bitcoin mining rewards, the introduction of Runes has offered a considerable respite. Beard unequivocally stated, ""what we lost in rewards, we made up for in transaction fees."" Marathon’s Chief Growth Officer, Adam Swick, is of a similar mindset. Swick pointed out the escalating fees following the halving, fueled by the launch of Runes and broader network activity. ""This has certainly helped to lessen the impact of halving, or perhaps delay the impact depending on how long the fees persist,"" he commented. Runes have considerably contributed to miners' earnings, generating over 1,200 BTC worth of transaction fees since the Bitcoin halving event. Runes, thanks to the creation of Inscriptions by Casey Rodarmor, have enabled users to create more efficient fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain—leading to varied reactions from the Bitcoin community. However, for mining firms, the impact of Runes has been more than welcome, given that transaction fees provide a useful buffer against Bitcoin reward reductions. Beard, while speaking about the impact of Runes, indicated that emerging functionalities being built on Bitcoin might result in the trend leaning towards higher transaction fees in the future. According to both Beard and Swick, innovations like Ordinals and Runes that increase the usage and adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain have been a boon for miners and the Bitcoin ecosystem, particularly as the competition for diminishing block rewards intensifies. The rise in the utilization of Bitcoin's network, attracting more users and thus leading to potentially higher transaction fees, signifies a positive development.

2024-04-29,"According to CryptoPotato, a Bitcoin miner has successfully solved a network block independently, earning a full 3.125 BTC reward. This event occurred at block 841,286, following the fourth Bitcoin halving on April 20 at block 840,000. The halving reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, currently valued at approximately $200,000. On April 29, Con Kolivas, a software engineer and administrator from the solo mining pool ckpool, announced that an individual miner, not a large company, had solved the 282nd solo block in Bitcoin’s history. This is a rare occurrence, with only 282 instances recorded out of approximately 841,300 blocks produced since Bitcoin’s inception 14 years ago. Kolivas noted that this miner had a significant hash rate of approximately 120PH (peta hashes) at the time, equivalent to around 0.12 EH (exa hashes), with an average of around 12PH over a week. This hash rate was roughly 0.02% of the total network hash rate. Kolivas speculated that this miner had either recently transitioned from pooled mining post-halving, likely due to no longer covering their electricity costs for pooled mining, or they may have been intermittently hashing or renting large amounts alone. The achievement is significant due to the rarity of mining a valid block solo, likened to winning the lottery. Mining Bitcoin involves participants contributing computational power to solve and add the next block to the network. However, with the increasing price of Bitcoin, mining has become more popular, leading to increased competitiveness, known as difficulty, and an increase in hash rate, or network horsepower. As a result, it has become nearly impossible to solve a block alone due to this high competition. In March 2023, a solo miner successfully secured the entire 6.25 BTC reward for solving a block. However, Bitcoin prices were considerably lower during that time, resulting in the reward being valued at around $150,000. The most recent solo block was mined on April 5, just a couple of weeks before the halving. A solo miner successfully solved block 837,814 with a hash rate of 7PH. Notably, the reward was valued at approximately $422,750 at the time.

This occurred despite Bitcoin's significant price rally during the same period, according to a press release issued on Monday afternoon. With expectations that MicroStrategy might adopt the new digital asset fair value accounting standard, thereby yielding a considerable profit due to Bitcoin's remarkable first quarter rally, the company opted to maintain its traditional accounting standard. As per these metrics, the firm valued its Bitcoin holdings at $23,680 per unit (totalling $5.1 billion) at the end of the quarter, as opposed to the March closing price of $71,028 per bitcoin (BTC) (totalling $15.2 billion). MicroStrategy further revealed an April addition of 122 tokens to its Bitcoin holdings, which pushed its total accumulated assets to 214,400 bitcoins (BTC). As of the current Bitcoin (BTC) price of approximately $63,000, the company's holdings are estimated to be valued at about $13.5 billion. Andrew Kang, CFO of MicroStrategy, stated during the earnings call that early adoption of the new digital asset fair value accounting rule remains part of the company's future plan, with the best time for implementation currently under evaluation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has made it mandatory for this new rule to be implemented by January 1, 2025, but allows early adoption. In the wake of these revelations, shares of MicroStrategy are observed to have dipped by 3.3% in after-hours trading.","MicroStrategy Incorporated has reported a net operating loss of $53.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 due to a digital asset impairment charge of $191.6 million.

Cryptocurrencies have retracted their weekend gains, with the broad-market CoinDesk Market Index experiencing a 3% decline in the last 24 hours.

2024-04-29,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin is potentially entering its fifth consecutive negative weekly close, a pattern historically associated with bear market conditions. The pattern was noted by Twitter user MisterCh0c, who faced criticism from more optimistic followers. They pointed out that the current drawdown, which has been ongoing throughout April, is mild compared to previous bull markets. Bitcoin closed at a weekly high of approximately $71,400 on March 31, and closed this Sunday at roughly $63,000, marking a 12% drop. Lead Glassnode analyst James Check supported this observation, stating that Bitcoin has only declined by a maximum of 20% from its high of $73,000 this cycle. In contrast, the 2017 bull market saw multiple drawdowns ranging from 20% to 30%. Despite these pullbacks being typical for a bull market, many are surprised that the selling pressure on Bitcoin has extended to the newly launched Bitcoin spot ETFs. These funds have absorbed over $12 billion of net inflows since January, but these flows have stagnated over the past month. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have often exceeded inflows to all other Bitcoin ETFs combined. Macro investment analyst Jim Bianco suggests that the dominant buyers of Bitcoin ETFs are 'degen retail' investors. He argues this is a bearish sign, as these investors are likely to 'bail at the first signs of trouble', especially when the price falls below their cost basis of $58,000. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas counters this by noting that most investors have not yet reported their ETF holdings in 13F filings. He also points out that it can take time for advisors to get involved, as evidenced by BITO, the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has 40% of its investment holdings owned by advisors after 30 months on the market.","Bitcoin closed at a weekly high of $71,400 on March 31 and closed this Sunday at roughly $63,000, marking a 12% drop.

2024-04-28,"According to CryptoPotato, a notebook paper with the phrase 'Buy Bitcoin,' which gained fame during a 2017 broadcast featuring then-US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, has been auctioned for 16 BTC, approximately $1.027 million. The auction took place at PubKey, a Bitcoin-themed bar in New York City, and was organized by auction house Scarce.City. The highest bidder, known pseudonymously as 'Squirrekkywrath,' won the sign in a week-long auction. Christian Langalis, also known as the 'Bitcoin Sign Guy,' organized the auction and attended the event. Scarce.City reported that the transaction set a record for the platform. After the platform's 15% fee, Langalis is expected to receive around $875,000, equivalent to 13.6 BTC. The 'Buy Bitcoin' sign, written on a yellow legal pad, symbolizes Bitcoin's emergence in the global financial landscape. This physical artifact is one of the few widely recognized symbols of Bitcoin, given its primarily digital nature. The auctioned notepad also includes Langalis’ original notes and sketches of the sign from that historic day. Langalis was reportedly a 22-year-old intern at the Cato Institute at the time of the famous incident. The funds raised from the auction will support Langalis’ new venture, Tirrel Corp, which aims to create a Bitcoin Lightning network wallet on Urbit. In 2019, Langalis created and sold 21 replicas of the iconic 'Buy Bitcoin' sign, which fetched an average price of 0.8 BTC each, approximately $51,300 per piece today. These replicas are displayed in the offices of venture firms such as Paradigm, Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, and the crypto think-tank Coin Center. After Langalis held up the sign during a 2017 House Financial Services hearing, he was escorted out of the building for violating committee rules. However, the image of the sign quickly spread across the internet. Following the event, bitcoin’s price surged by 3.7% at the time of the broadcast. Since then, bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed, going from around $2,700 in July 2017 to a peak of over $73,000 last month. This increase has been in part due to significant regulatory decisions in the United States, including allowing the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year.","The 'Buy Bitcoin' sign has been sold for 16 BTC, approximately $1.027 million at PubKey, a Bitcoin-themed bar in New York City.

2024-04-28,"According to U.Today, Josh Olszewicz, a renowned cryptocurrency trader, has identified a Tenkan/Kijun crossover on Bitcoin's daily chart, which could potentially signal the onset of a bearish trend. The Tenkan Sen is calculated by dividing the highest high and the lowest low in price over the past nine periods. This line often acts as a short-term support level during an uptrend, suggesting that the price might find some buying interest at this point. Conversely, it can also serve as a short-term resistance level if a particular asset is in a downtrend. The Kijun Sen, also known as the base line, is determined by adding the highest high and the lowest low over the past 27 periods and dividing this sum by two. This base line can function as a medium-term support level. The relationship between these two lines could offer crucial signals to traders about the current market condition. The Tenkan Sen crossing below the Kijun Sen is generally viewed as a bearish indicator, as it suggests that the market is yielding to bearish pressure. However, this signal may not necessarily spell the end for the bullish trend, as the crossover occurred below the Ichimoku cloud. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is trading at $63,645, according to data from CoinGecko. It's worth noting that Bitcoin is currently underperforming against Ethereum, which has seen a surge of approximately 6% in the last 24 hours.","The Tenkan/Kijun crossover on Bitcoin's daily chart could signal the onset of a bearish trend.

The report states that the number of non-empty Bitcoin wallets has been growing rapidly, despite the high volatility leading to fluctuating prices.

2024-04-28,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's fourth halving has taken place, reducing the block rewards to 3.125 BTC. Despite the historical significance of this event as a catalyst for a new bull cycle, there is ongoing debate about the diminishing effects of this halving. However, there are several other positive developments in the Bitcoin sector that could stimulate interest in the coming months. In mid-January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs to begin trading on local exchanges. This is arguably the most positive news this year. These products, led by BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC, attracted billions of dollars worth of BTC in just a few months. This demand led to a significant increase in spot BTC prices, with the cryptocurrency nearly doubling its USD value and reaching a new all-time high before the halving for the first time. However, as the inflows began to decrease and even turned negative on some occasions, BTC's price growth was halted, and the asset fell by about ten thousand dollars from its March peaks. Reports suggest that these ETFs are crucial for Bitcoin's continued growth as an asset. BNY Mellon, one of the oldest and largest banking organizations in the United States, recently revealed its exposure to some of the spot BTC ETFs trading locally. BNY has been a long-time supporter of the cryptocurrency industry, even when most US banks were publicly criticizing or ignoring it. Another positive development related to the US ETF market came from Morgan Stanley. The Wall Street giant is reportedly considering allowing its 15,000 brokers to recommend clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETF funds. While the US demand may be slowing down, there are more positive developments from other jurisdictions. Hong Kong is prepared to launch its own spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs soon, even though the impact will likely be smaller due to the market's size compared to the US. Analysts such as Lark Davis believe the launch of spot ETFs in Hong Kong will create a 'massive ripple effect' across the entire Asian continent, with more countries expected to follow suit.","Bitcoin's fourth halving has taken place, reducing the block rewards to 3.125 BTC.

2024-04-28,"According to U.Today, a notable decrease in Bitcoin whale activity has been observed since March 14 by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez. This has led to speculation about the potential influence on Bitcoin's price. Martinez's study shows a significant reduction in transactions involving amounts over $100,000, following Bitcoin's rise to a new peak of $73,750 per BTC. Martinez's data reveals that in the last 24 hours, transactions over $100,000 amounted to 2,896, while those surpassing $1 million totaled 521. Before Bitcoin's peak, whale activity showed a proportional increase, peaking at around 4,500 daily transactions valued at a million dollars or more, and approximately 24,500 transactions exceeding $100,000. Martinez suggests that the lack of significant whale activity could be contributing to Bitcoin's recent price stagnation, as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain momentum amid decreasing volatility. The analyst's observations raise questions about the role of large-scale investors in influencing market dynamics, especially considering their reduced participation. The drop in whale activity represents a divergence from previous patterns, where increased transaction volumes by major players often coincided with significant price movements. Martinez's evaluation suggests the possibility of a resurgence in whale transactions serving as a trigger for renewed bullish sentiment in the Bitcoin market.

The report indicates that these funds have ceased accumulating coins for over a month, which could potentially impact Bitcoin's future price trajectory. From January to mid-March, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated 200,000 BTC, despite significant outflows from Grayscale. This accumulation coincided with Bitcoin's price surge from $40,000 to $75,000. However, the inflow of BTC into ETFs has since halted, leading to a stagnation in price movement. The report states, 'If you're wondering why Bitcoin is stuck in the $60k range, look no further. The ETFs have stopped accumulating coins for a while now. They are the only game in town. No demand from them means no price appreciation.' Despite this, Ecoinometrics advises investors not to lose sight of the bigger picture, asserting that Bitcoin is the only hedge investors need against debasement. The report also compared the performance of Bitcoin, gold, and the NASDAQ over the last decade, adjusted for the growth of the global monetary base. It found that while gold has remained flat, merely keeping pace with global liquidity, the NASDAQ has seen a threefold increase. However, Bitcoin has outperformed both by a significant margin, boasting a 44-fold increase in value. This underscores Bitcoin's effectiveness as a hedge in the current economic climate.

In his analysis, Brandt delves into the concept of exponential decay, indicating that each successive Bitcoin bull cycle has seen a diminishing exponential advance, with a loss of about 80% of the momentum from previous cycles. The current surge marks the fifth significant bull cycle in Bitcoin's history. Applying this trend to the current cycle, Brandt projects a potential peak of around $72,723, a figure already reached in recent trading.

Nakamoto, who laid the foundation for Bitcoin's development and guided its early growth, abruptly ceased all communications and vanished in 2011. This event has remained one of the most enduring mysteries in the cryptocurrency world, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and speculation. On April 23, 2011, Nakamoto sent his final emails to fellow developers, stating he had 'moved on to other things' and that the cryptocurrency was in 'good hands.' Three days later, he completely disappeared. One of his final acts before disappearing was handing over a cryptographic key he had used to send network-wide alerts. This key was not just any piece of digital information, but a powerful symbol of trust and authority within the Bitcoin network, allowing Nakamoto to broadcast messages to all participants. The decision to relinquish this key was a clear message that Bitcoin was no longer under the control of its creator; it belonged to the community. This action aligns with Nakamoto's overarching vision for Bitcoin as a decentralized and trustless system, free from centralized control or authority. It symbolized the transition from centralized leadership to community-driven stewardship of the world's first cryptocurrency. Present-day Bitcoin operates as a decentralized system with no single, centralized location or controlling authority.

2024-04-27,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a net withdrawal of $218 million, marking one of the largest outflows in the sector's history. On Thursday, Bitcoin funds experienced an overall outflow of $218 million, including a $23 million drawdown for the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. This was the first such event since the fund started trading on January 11, alongside peers such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. BlackRock's fund, on Wednesday, ended a 71-day streak of continuous inflows. The group of over a dozen ETFs, which had been breaking records on its way to amassing combined assets of around $54 billion, has recently seen a decrease in demand. Bitcoin ETFs, which offer investors the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, have been a popular choice among both experienced and novice investors. However, the recent outflow could signal a change in investor sentiment. The timing of the outflow coincides with a period of increased volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, characterized by sharp price swings. Bitcoin dropped to lows of $62,747 in Thursday's trading as demand for riskier investments was dampened by waning optimism for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.86% in the last 24 hours to $64,498, down from a record high of $73,798 set in mid-March. Despite the outflow from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market remains positive. Increased institutional acceptance and continued interest from regular investors are driving market development and innovation. While short-term fluctuations are expected, market participants remain optimistic about the long-term potential of Bitcoin and digital assets.","Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a net withdrawal of $218 million.

2024-04-27,"According to CryptoPotato, the Bitcoin network has achieved a new milestone with its daily transactions peaking at 927,000. This surpasses the previous record of 724,000 set in December 2023. The surge in transactions is attributed to the launch of Runes, a new token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain. Since its introduction following the halving on April 20, Runes has accounted for over two-thirds of all Bitcoin transactions, with more than 2.38 million transactions processed, making up 68% of the total. The data, sourced from a Dune Analytics dashboard shared by blockchain research firm Crypto Koryo, shows the significant adoption and usage of Runes alongside traditional Bitcoin transactions. These include ordinary peer-to-peer transactions, BRC-20s, and Ordinals. Runes experienced its highest activity on April 23, surpassing 750,000 transactions. However, the following day saw a significant decrease, with the transaction count dropping to 312,000, less than half of the previous day’s total. The new protocol, introduced by Ordinals Creator Casey Rodarmor, is promoted as a more efficient way to generate tokens on the Bitcoin network compared to BRC-20. However, some industry experts have expressed concerns. Nikita Zhavoronkov from Blockchair, for instance, criticized the amount of block space Runes transactions are occupying, suggesting that Bitcoin has deviated from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The industry appears to be divided on whether Runes will offer a sustainable revenue source for Bitcoin miners.","The Bitcoin network has reached a new milestone with its daily transactions peaking at 927,000.

2024-04-27,"According to CryptoPotato, the meme coin sector has seen substantial growth, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) leading the pack. Newer tokens such as dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) are also gaining traction due to strong community support. Analysts are optimistic about the potential of this sector, especially after the Bitcoin halving, which has historically triggered market surges. The meme coin sector has made significant progress during the latest bull cycle, with its market capitalization briefly surpassing $60 billion. This growth is largely due to popular assets like DOGE and SHIB, which remain trending among investors. Newer tokens, including WIF, Bonk Inu (BONK), and PEPE, are also gaining popularity. Currently, DOGE and SHIB account for over 60% of the sector's market capitalization, and they are the only meme coins to have ever crossed the $10 billion mark. The AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, was asked whether another meme coin could reach this milestone. It estimated that success could be driven by strong community support, a viral social media presence, and increased investor interest. WIF and PEPE are some of the meme coins that have gained a solid supporter base. The dogwifhat community recently raised $650,000 to put the token's logo on the Sphere, a famous entertainment arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The token also received backing from prominent industry participants, such as Arthur Hayes. A study conducted a few months ago estimated that Shiba Inu has the strongest community base among meme coins, with DOGE and PEPE rounding out the top three. The frog-themed digital asset currently has a market cap of over $3 billion, making it a major contender among the leading ones. Analysts remain optimistic that the meme coin sector will continue to flourish during the bull cycle. One contributing factor could be the recent Bitcoin halving, which has historically been a precursor for a major resurgence in the entire cryptocurrency industry. Shiba Inu, in particular, is poised for a price ascent in the near future due to its aggressive burning mechanism, the development of the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, and the predominantly negative SHIB exchange netflow on a weekly scale.","The meme coin sector has seen significant growth during the latest bull cycle, with its market capitalization briefly surpassing $60 billion.

2024-04-26,"According to U.Today, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has set a unique record as a global Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product with an unusually high underperformance. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas reported that GBTC has sustained a 72-day outflow streak, a record unmatched by any other known ETF in the industry. This trend has been ongoing since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the United States in January, with investors consistently withdrawing funds, albeit at varying rates. Balchunas's statement has sparked reactions from the community, with many attributing GBTC's underperformance to the firm's fee decisions. At its inception, while other issuers set a minimal fee, Grayscale announced it would charge 1.5%, a significant amount compared to the average 0.2% charged by its competing ETF issuers. Grayscale executives defended this decision, arguing that GBTC's legacy and the expertise of its team would render the fees insignificant in the long run. However, current data trends are being viewed as a major red flag that may not bode well for Grayscale in the near future. The spot Bitcoin ETF market appears to be gradually losing momentum. This observation is based on the recent break in the stellar performance of BlackRock’s IBIT. The Bitcoin ETF recorded its first halt in inflow earlier this week, indicating a potential shift away from risk assets. This drop coincided with a period of intense bearish volatility in the price of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the premier asset is trading at $63,628.56, down by 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

On-chain analysts have noticed a significant increase in inflows to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, with a substantial portion of these inflows coming from Bitcoin whales. This information was revealed in a CryptoQuant Quicktake by anonymous crypto analyst Phi Deltalytics. On April 25, another analyst, Woominkyu, noted that the unrealized profits of long-term Bitcoin whales had increased significantly, particularly with Bitcoin's value exceeding $60,000. Despite the increase in profits, Woominkyu observed that these whales had not yet cashed out. He pointed out a spot on his chart indicating a significant rise in unrealized profits, suggesting that this group of Bitcoin investors was maintaining their positions. However, he also warned that any move to realize these profits could impact the market. Approximately 24 hours after Woominkyu's post, Phi Deltalytics reported a notable increase in Bitcoin exchange inflow, with the majority seemingly coming from whales. He suggested that this increase could indicate significant profit-taking by whales during the ongoing 2024 Bitcoin bull run. While he acknowledged that such metrics can sometimes produce false signals, he advised caution when interpreting market dynamics. In addition to Bitcoin whales, long-term holders of the digital asset have also been cashing out. Woominkyu noted that the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of long-term holders had surpassed that of short-term holders over a seven-day moving average, indicating that the former group is realizing more profits. He also explained that the SOPR of long-term holders has generally decreased over time, but there are instances when it experiences an uptick, often preceding spikes in Bitcoin's price. These upticks suggest that long-term investors are capitalizing on price surges to realize profits. Investors are advised to be cautious of potential price corrections and increased volatility, as the SOPR is currently high. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is consolidating between $60,000 and $70,000.

This limited range trading, depicted in the ETH/USDT daily chart, is unlikely to persist in the long run, indicating potential directional swings in the imminent future. ETH/USDT daily chart.

On the other hand, if prices plunge and breach the $3,056 support level, it might suggest that bears are gaining control. The ETH/USDT pair could then retest critical support at $2,852. A further plunge below this level may potentially initiate a decline towards $2,700.

However, bulls are not backing down, helping to alleviate a rapid price decline. The price could potentially retreat to the moving averages, establishing anticipated support levels. If the price uniquely rebounds off the moving averages, it could increase the chances of breaching the $635 resistance level. BNB/USDT daily chart.

Solana Price Analysis: SOL Faces Resistance at $162, Major Moves Expected Solana demonstrated a downturn from the overhead resistance of $162 on April 24, pointing to the significant activity of the bears at higher levels. With the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) gradually sloping down to $153 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the negative territory, it suggests that bears currently hold the upper hand. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView The SOL/USDT pair may well descend towards a strong support level at $126. Suppose the price robustly rebounds off this level. In that case, it could represent a potential scenario where the pair could remain trapped in the price range between $162 and $126 for a more extended period. However, the first positive indication would be a break and closing price above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $168. Such a move could pave the way for a possible rally towards $205. Conversely, a break below $126 could catapult the SOL/USDT pair down to the $100 mark. XRP Price Analysis: XRP Bulls Eye Support at Uptrend Line Ripple's native digital token, XRP is currently trading below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.54, signaling a bearish market. Despite this, bulls are showing resilience, aiming to establish support at the uptrend line. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView Should the price make a rebound off the uptrend line and propel above the 20-day EMA, it could suggest a weakening of the bears' influence. Under such circumstances, the XRP/USDT pair might subsequently attempt a rally toward the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.59 and potentially ascend to $0.69. Contrarily, if the price continues on a downward trajectory and breaches the uptrend line, it could signify a firm bear grip on the market. The XRP/USDT pair might then plunge to $0.46, a level where robust support from the bulls is anticipated. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis: Symmetrical Triangle Forms as Bulls and Bears Lock Horns Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently traced a symmetrical triangle pattern, suggesting an ongoing bout of indecision between the bulls and the bears. With the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sloping downwards to $0.16 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) positioned in the negative zone, it implies that the easiest path for the price lies downwards. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView Should the price dip and sustain below the triangle, the DOGE/USDT pair might likely tumble toward $0.12, indicating a bearish outcome for the popular meme coin. Contrarily, if the price manages to rebound from the current level and breach the triangle, it would signal aggressive buying activities on dips. This would enhance the chances of an uphill break from the ongoing downtrend line. Subsequently, the DOGE/USDT pair could ascend toward $0.21, hinting at a bullish market outlook. Cardano Price Analysis: ADA Oscillates at Crucial $0.46 Support Level Cardano's recent price action bears witness to a dip from the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.50 that happened on April 23, eventually reaching a vital support level at $0.46. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView If the price experiences a rebound off the $0.46 level, and in turn, establishes a position above the 20-day EMA, it is indicative that the correction phase may have run its course. Under such a bullish condition, the ADA/USDT pair might venture a rally up to the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.59 and further to $0.68. However, a continued downward movement that leads to a break below $0.46 signifies the bears' dominance. Under such a scenario, the ADA/USDT pair might experience a slump, reaching the critical support at $0.40. A definitive breach of this level potentially signals a resumption of the downtrend. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: SHIB Stuck Between Moving Averages, Market Indecision Prevails Shiba Inu's price performance has seen it oscillating between the moving averages over the past few days. This pattern is indicative of an indecisive market, with both bulls and bears vying for control.

Mow quoted Nakamoto's statement from the Bitcoin white paper, which suggested an alternative method of maintaining privacy compared to traditional banking models. Nakamoto proposed keeping private keys anonymous, allowing transactions to be visible but not linked to any specific individual. Mow's comments sparked a response from Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, who argued that 'Pseudonymity is a weak form of privacy.' Mow retorted by challenging Guillemet to reveal Nakamoto's real identity. In a separate conversation, Mow predicted the emergence of 'Omega Bitcoin candles,' a term referring to large greed trading candles associated with high volatility. He believes that the recent Bitcoin halving, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, will create a Bitcoin supply shock. This, coupled with the demand shock created by spot Bitcoin ETFs buying up BTC from the market, could lead to the appearance of Omega candles, potentially driving Bitcoin's value to the anticipated $1 million mark. Following the halving, Bitcoin's value increased by nearly 10% to reach $67,000. However, it has since declined by 3.76%, with Bitcoin currently trading in the $64,400 range.","The CEO of Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, Samson Mow, recently engaged in a discussion about Bitcoin privacy and the identity of its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

Kiyosaki, the author of the classic finance management book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', stated that the U.S. economy is in a state of depression, defined as an economy experiencing subpar growth. He pointed out that while the economy may be growing, it is doing so below its potential. Kiyosaki highlighted that the economy grew by 3.4% in the last quarter of 2023, but in the first quarter of 2024, it grew by less than half of that, at 1.6%. He believes that there will not be a soft landing for the U.S. economy, but remains optimistic as the economy continues to grow. He also urged his followers to disregard fake news. In response to Kiyosaki's statement, members of various cryptocurrency communities shared their thoughts. Some suggested that the definition of a depression should be revised based on Kiyosaki's explanation, while others criticized the author. A majority of the comments were positive, with many praising Bitcoin and expressing gratitude for Kiyosaki's insights. In addition to his views on the economy, Kiyosaki has also made predictions about Bitcoin. Earlier this year, he stated that he expected Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by September. He cited the Bitcoin halving event, which occurred in April, as a major driver for this anticipated price increase. Kiyosaki also revealed plans to purchase an additional 10 Bitcoins before the halving, in anticipation of a significant price rise.","The U.S. economy is in a state of depression.

2024-04-25,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin traders seem to have reduced their bets on the world's largest cryptocurrency as its two major driving forces diminish. On April 19, the Bitcoin funding rate, which is the premium paid by traders to open new long positions in the token's perpetual futures market, turned negative for the first time since October 2023. This metric indicates a decrease in Bitcoin demand following a period where a series of US spot-Bitcoin ETFs pushed the token to record highs. However, net inflows to these ETFs have decreased in recent weeks. The much-anticipated halving, a quadrennial event that cuts the rewards earned by miners that secure the blockchain and reduces the supply of new coins in the market, had a minimal effect on Bitcoin's price last week. Bitcoin reached a peak of $73,798 in March but has since corrected nearly 13%, trading at $64,214 as of 08:35 a.m. on Thursday in London. The enthusiasm of buyers for the original cryptocurrency has cooled partly due to increasing risk aversion linked to tensions in the Middle East, as well as expected delays to Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin funding rates reached a three-year high in March, indicating an overheated market, but were below zero as of Tuesday. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, stated that this certainly means that the desire for traders to open long positions has eased. Vetle Lunde, an analyst at K33 Research, noted that the current 11-day neutral-to-below-neutral funding rate streak is unusual, with past dips promptly followed by a flurry of leveraged bets. He added that the lengthy nature of this perp discount could point toward further price consolidation. The drop-off in the funding rate coincides with a decline in daily inflows into the US spot-Bitcoin ETFs. So far this month, the group of 11 products has seen a net inflow of $170 million, significantly less than the $4 billion they garnered in the same number of trading days in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.","Bitcoin traders have reduced their bets on the world's largest cryptocurrency as its two major driving forces diminish.

2024-04-25,"According to BlockBeats, Bitcoin mining difficulty has reached a new historical high. The data from BTC.com shows that the mining difficulty was adjusted by 1.99% to 88.1 T at block height 840,672 on April 25, 2024. The current average network hashrate stands at 642.78 EH/s. The adjustment in mining difficulty is a significant event in the Bitcoin network. It is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks, to maintain the block discovery rate at one every 10 minutes. When more miners join the network, the difficulty increases. Conversely, if miners start to leave, the difficulty decreases. The recent increase in mining difficulty to a record high indicates that more computational power is being invested in securing the Bitcoin network. This could be a sign of increased confidence in the future of Bitcoin, as miners are willing to invest more resources in mining activities. However, it also means that mining Bitcoin has become more challenging, potentially discouraging smaller players from participating. The average network hashrate of 642.78 EH/s is a measure of the processing power of the entire Bitcoin network. When the network reaches this rate, it is capable of making 642.78 quintillion attempts per second to solve the mathematical problem that allows a miner to add a new block to the blockchain. This high hashrate indicates a high level of security for the Bitcoin network, as it would require an enormous amount of computational power to launch a successful attack. In conclusion, the recent adjustment in Bitcoin mining difficulty and the high network hashrate reflect the robustness and security of the Bitcoin network.

2024-04-25,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin's price, currently hovering around the $63,800 mark, has investors on edge as crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out a worrying pattern on the charts. Martinez's recent analysis of the leading cryptocurrency's performance reveals two significant sell signals, suggesting possible downward pressure on Bitcoin. The first signal is the appearance of a 'death cross' between the 50 and 100 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) on the Bitcoin 12-hour chart. This ominous pattern takes place when the short-term moving average, in this case, the 50-day one, crosses below the long-term moving average of 100 or 200 days. Historically, the death cross has been seen as a bearish indicator, hinting at a potential shift in momentum from bullish to bearish sentiment. Adding to the worry is the emergence of a red 9 candlestick from the TD Sequential indicator. This tool, developed by market analyst Thomas DeMark, is used in technical analysis to identify potential price exhaustion and trend reversals. In this situation, the red 9 candlestick implies that Bitcoin's upward momentum might be waning, potentially setting the stage for a corrective move. If Bitcoin fails to maintain above the critical support level of $63,300, investors might need to prepare for further downside. Martinez cautions that a breach of this level could pave the way for Bitcoin to test lower support zones at $61,000 or even $59,000. The current price of Bitcoin, down 16% from its all-time high, further emphasizes the uncertainty in the cryptocurrency markets. As crypto enthusiasts closely watch the evolving price action, all eyes are now on whether Bitcoin will succumb to the ominous signals of the impending death cross or defy expectations with a bullish resurgence.","Bitcoin's price is currently hovering around the $63,800 mark.

2024-04-25,"According to U.Today, recent data indicates that long-term Bitcoin whales are amassing substantial profits despite market fluctuations. Despite a minor downturn in the broader crypto market, these Bitcoin whales appear to be maintaining their positions, which could have potential market impacts if they decide to liquidate. CryptoQuant, a well-known cryptocurrency analytics platform, recently published data showing the unrealized profits of long-term Bitcoin whales. The data reveals a significant trend: as the price of Bitcoin has been increasing, long-term whales have been experiencing a steady growth in their unrealized profits. This rise in unrealized profits suggests that these whales are opting to hold onto their positions, rather than selling at the current price levels. This behavior among long-term whales is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the confidence these large-scale investors have in Bitcoin's long-term potential, even amidst short-term market volatility. Secondly, their decision to accumulate profits could potentially influence market dynamics. If these whales decide to start taking profits by selling their Bitcoin holdings, it could result in increased selling pressure and subsequent price fluctuations.

Many traders track ETF flows to gauge market sentiment, so the lack of fresh inflows into BlackRock's fund on Wednesday could be interpreted as a bearish signal for the market, at least in the short term. However, it's important to note that these ETFs initially attracted stronger-than-expected inflows following their launch. The ETF has now reached $20 billion in assets under management (AUM). For comparison, the SPDR Gold ETF (GLD) took almost three years to reach the same milestone. Despite the total AUM of GLD being almost three times larger, IBIT has surpassed GLD in daily trading volume. It's common for ETFs to stop attracting flows once they reach a certain size, and BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has managed to record one of the longest streaks of inflows. However, it still falls short of funds such as the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) and the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ). Despite the implications of IBIT's now-interrupted inflow streak, the overall sentiment in the crypto market appears to be bearish.

2024-04-25,"According to U.Today, a recent report by Fortune, citing data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, reveals that approximately 1.8 million Bitcoins, equivalent to $121 billion, are held in wallets that have been inactive for over a decade. These dormant coins represent 8.5% of Bitcoin's 19.7 million circulating supply. The report does not clarify what proportion of these cryptocurrencies are lost forever, but it suggests that the total number of such coins should stabilize around 1.5 million. Earlier this month, a Satoshi-era whale, a term used for a large holder of Bitcoin, became active after a decade of inactivity, holding $115 million. When such wallets become active after a long period of dormancy, it is often assumed that the owners might want to take profits following a price rally. However, the report indicates that there is no direct correlation between the activation of long-dormant wallets and significant price movements. Chainalysis has observed that old wallets tend to be activated at a relatively predictable rate. The majority of these wallets do not usually make headlines due to their small size. In fact, 99% of all wallets considered lost contain less than 50 BTC, equivalent to $3.2 million at current prices. Data from Glassnode shows that over 68% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply has been inactive for more than a year. This decrease in supply available on the market could be a bullish development, considering the growing demand following the approval of several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January.

2024-04-25,"According to CryptoPotato, blockchain developers are nearing the launch of rollups on Bitcoin, which could provide the original cryptocurrency network with 'unlimited smart contract functionality' and scaling capabilities. BitcoinOS recently released the whitepaper for 'BitSNARK and Grail', a system designed to connect Bitcoin to layer 2 rollups and blockchains in a trust-minimized manner. This new rollup system is a development of BitVM, a Bitcoin-based computing paradigm discovered by Robin Linus in the previous year. BitVM's most significant application was its ability to verify 'Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge' (SNARKs) on Bitcoin, which paved the way for Bitcoin Rollup Bridges and scaling technologies similar to Optimism or Arbitrum on Ethereum. BitSNARK, built on BitVM, uses a software library specifically optimized for this purpose, enabling bridges that are cost-effective, efficient, and secure enough for practical use. 'This is a solution to Bitcoin’s trilemma of scale, computational expressivity, and decentralization,' Edan Yago, one of the paper’s authors, posted on Twitter. He added that no softfork, upgrades, or new op-codes are necessary for this development. Existing Bitcoin layer 2 systems have faced significant tradeoffs compared to scaling systems built on more expressive blockchains like Ethereum. For instance, Bitcoin’s lightning network can become impractical for individual use due to the cost and complexity of channel management. Additionally, Bitcoin sidechains like Liquid and Rootstock require a federation of third parties to manage the 'bridge' between L1 and L2, representing a single point of failure for both chains. The new system, Grail, uses BitSNARK to generate SNARK proofs for Bitcoin and rollup transactions, enabling secure asset transfers between L1 and L2 rollups. The Grail bridge requires at least two operators to function, but theoretically, any number could be supported. The BitcoinOS team is currently aiming to design a bridge with over 100 operators. 'The trust assumption works unless all parties collude,' Yago added. 'That’s what makes it so strong.'","A new system is being developed to connect Bitcoin to layer 2 rollups and blockchains in a trust-minimized manner.

2024-04-24,"According to BlockBeats, the recent surge in Bitcoin network activity has led to a common issue among new wallet users: despite having sufficient balance, they often encounter a 'UTXO insufficient' message during on-chain operations. This article aims to explain the concept of UTXO, why 'UTXO insufficient' situations occur, and how to split UTXO. UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Output, is a core concept in Bitcoin. It is a method of recording transaction output status, tracking each unspent transaction output to determine which Bitcoin belongs to which address. To simplify, each UTXO is like a banknote with a specific value (amount of Bitcoin) and a lock that can only be opened by a private key. When you want to send Bitcoin, you need to select some 'banknotes', merge them into a new 'banknote', and re-lock it with the recipient's lock. For instance, if you have two UTXOs, one worth 10 Bitcoin and another worth 20 Bitcoin, you can merge them into a new UTXO worth 30 Bitcoin and re-lock it with the recipient's address. This completes a transaction, sending 10 and 20 Bitcoin to the recipient and generating a new UTXO. The need to split UTXO arises because platforms like Magic Eden prohibit the use of UTXOs that have not been confirmed by the Bitcoin network for transactions. Regardless of the amount contained in a UTXO, once it has been used and is unconfirmed, it cannot be used for other operations. This is why users often encounter 'UTXO insufficient' messages despite having sufficient wallet balance. However, having more UTXOs is not necessarily better. When UTXOs are too fragmented and the individual amounts are too small, a large payment would require the merging of many UTXOs, leading to increased transaction fees. With the current high transaction rates on the Bitcoin network, this would further increase transaction costs. The most commonly used tool for splitting and merging UTXOs is Wizz.Cash. Users can link their wallets in the top right corner of the website, add rows by clicking 'Add Amount And Recipient' (each added row means a new UTXO), and fill in the amount for each UTXO and the recipient's address. UTXOs typically increase with wallet transactions, but funds just withdrawn from exchanges are often a single large UTXO. Users with a large demand for engraving runes/inscriptions can prepare by splitting in advance.",The recent surge in Bitcoin network activity has led to a common issue among new wallet users.

Since that time, Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed from approximately $2,300 to a record-breaking nearly $74,000 in March.

2024-04-24,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has sparked a discussion within the cryptocurrency community about the possibility of Bitcoin exceeding gold's market capitalization of $17.7 trillion. Woo's analysis focuses on the stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio, Bitcoin's inflationary path, and the growing trend of institutional adoption. Central to Woo's argument is the S2F model, a measure that assesses an asset's scarcity by comparing its current supply to its annual production. With Bitcoin's inflation rate now lower than gold's, Woo suggests that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to challenge the supremacy of the precious metal as a store-of-value asset. However, Woo also cautioned that it could take 5 to 10 years for Bitcoin's market capitalization to match its S2F valuation. He attributed this delay to several factors, including the slow integration of Bitcoin into institutional portfolios, the creation of regulatory frameworks, and the establishment of custody solutions. Despite this cautious outlook, Woo highlighted the potential for retail investors who can self-custody their Bitcoin holdings to benefit from the S2F model sooner. He suggested a divergence between institutional and retail adoption timelines, implying that the latter might adopt Bitcoin's value proposition more quickly. As the possibility of Bitcoin's market cap reaching $17 trillion is considered, questions remain about the potential effects on the cryptocurrency's price dynamics in the meantime.

2024-04-24,"According to U.Today, renowned trader Peter Brandt has sparked a debate with his recent assertion that Bitcoin has not reached a new all-time high (ATH) in the past three years. This statement may seem counterintuitive to many, given that Bitcoin reached its highest price level of $73,750.07 on March 14. However, Brandt argues that when adjusted for inflation, Bitcoin's price has not achieved a new high in three years. Brandt's argument is based on the metric of U.S. consumer purchasing power. Despite the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the recent Bitcoin halving event, Brandt believes that the cryptocurrency's price remains low when considering this factor. According to a chart he shared, Bitcoin last hit a high price in relation to consumers' buying power in the second half of 2021. Brandt, who has over 50 years of trading experience, expressed interest in hearing the perspectives of Bitcoin bears on the cryptocurrency's potential. He has been consistently vocal about his confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, a stance that contrasts with his views on Ethereum (ETH). In addition to Brandt, several other market investors and analysts have issued high price targets for Bitcoin. They anticipate that the spot Bitcoin ETF will trigger increased demand in the future, a trend that will be complemented by the reduced supply resulting from the halving.

2024-04-24,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin's average dormancy has reached a 13-year high, as per recent data shared by Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant. This increase in dormancy indicates a significant transfer of older Bitcoins to new holders, which could potentially reshape the cryptocurrency's ownership landscape. On March 23, Bitcoin's Average Dormancy reached a level of 227.684. Average Dormancy is a metric that represents the average number of 'destroyed days' of moved coins, calculated by dividing Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) by the total movement of coins. A higher Average Dormancy value typically suggests that long-term holders are moving or possibly selling their coins, which could indicate a potential price drop. The Average Dormancy of Bitcoin hitting a 13-year peak is significant for several reasons. Firstly, the increase implies that older, long-term holders of Bitcoin are either transferring their holdings or selling them to new investors. This shift could potentially alter the ownership distribution of Bitcoin, with new participants gaining a larger share of the market. Secondly, historically, spikes in Average Dormancy have often been followed by increased price volatility. If long-term holders are indeed selling or transferring their coins, it may lead to a greater supply of Bitcoin on the market, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. Lastly, the rising Average Dormancy could also reflect changing market sentiment among Bitcoin holders. Long-term investors may be responding to macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, or other market dynamics that influence their decision to hold or sell their assets. Ki Young Ju's observation about the shifting cap table for Bitcoin underscores the evolving nature of the market. As older Bitcoins are transferred or sold to new holders, the ownership dynamics of Bitcoin are undergoing a significant transformation. Market participants should closely monitor these developments, as they could have far-reaching implications for market sentiment in the coming months.","Bitcoin's average dormancy has reached a 13-year high.

Scaramucci's tweet sparked a lively discussion among his followers, with many expressing their satisfaction with holding Bitcoin. However, one user questioned Scaramucci's investment in the FTC exchange, asking whether it was 'guts or brains' that motivated his decision. In related news, Samson Mow, former Blockstream CSO and current CEO at Jan3, recently spoke to Forbes about the impact of the Bitcoin halving and his expectations for 'Omega candles'. Mow explained that halvings, which occur every four years, make Bitcoin more deflationary compared to fiat currencies and extend the issuance of BTC on the market. Before the halving, ETFs were purchasing between 5x and 15x the amount of Bitcoin produced by miners per day, creating a 'demand shock' for Bitcoin. Mow now anticipates the emergence of Omega candles, which are major trading candles that signify high volatility and significant shifts in the Bitcoin price. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,392, marking a nearly 9% increase since the halving day.","SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci believes that owning Bitcoin is no longer a matter of courage, but rather a 'question of brains'.

Contrary to the expectations of many investors and traders, the price of Bitcoin did not experience a significant increase after the halving event. In a tweet, Markus mocked those who anticipated a tenfold increase in the price of Bitcoin within days of the halving, which took place on April 20 at block 840,000. This marked the fourth halving in Bitcoin's history, reducing block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC and resulting in 450 new Bitcoins generated per day, down from 900 BTC previously. Markus sarcastically commented on the lack of a price surge, suggesting that those who relied on sources such as TikTok videos, Discord and Telegram chatrooms, and Twitter posts for their market information might now consider Bitcoin a scam. Prior to the halving, Markus had expressed skepticism about the potential for Bitcoin's price to increase. He has previously described cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as more akin to gambling than a sound investment. He has frequently stated that he does not believe anyone can accurately predict the direction of Bitcoin's price, attributing price increases to widespread buying and decreases to widespread selling. In the days leading up to the halving, Bitcoin's price increased by nearly 7%, adding approximately $5,000.

2024-04-23,"According to BlockBeats, the co-founder of Bitcoin NFT project Blob and the sixth-ranked contributor to the Ordinals protocol, @Elocremarc, has announced the introduction of 'recursive runes'. Following this announcement, the floor price of Blob has risen by 30%, breaking through 0.04 Bitcoin. The term 'recursive' is understood to refer to 'on-chain pointers' that allow inscriptions to reference data on the Bitcoin chain, including data from other inscriptions. This data can include the latest block height, specified block height, and other inscription data, among other things. These are also known as 'recursive endpoints'. @Elocremarc's proposal involves adding a 'recursive endpoint', specifically '/r/output'. Once this recursive endpoint is added, developers will be able to determine the quantity of corresponding runes and whether there are other inscriptions from the transaction output. This will allow inscriptions to change based on the quantity of runes. Based on current understanding, this requires maintaining corresponding inscriptions and runes in a UTXO. If the balance of the runes changes, it will not be possible to determine the change in the balance of the runes from the transaction output, thus causing the inscription image to change accordingly. This suggests that we can look forward to this type of gameplay, such as engraving inscriptions and recording a small image at the same time. Depending on the number of corresponding runes, the resulting small images will be different. More advanced gameplay, such as a full-chain Bitcoin game mentioned by Pizza Ninjas CEO @TO (for example, one NFT equals one game account, runes are game coins, and the game coin balance can be read directly on the NFT), may require further infrastructure support. Finally, it should be noted that the addition of the '/r/output' recursive endpoint is a prerequisite for @Elocremarc's plan. Currently, @Elocremarc has submitted a PR on the official Ordinals Github. If it passes smoothly, we will have 'recursive runes' to play with. In conclusion, 'runes' have been a hot topic in the crypto market over the past week, but despite high attention, they have not shown a good money-making effect. In addition to the 'pre-mining runes' of the project party and the 'fair casting' once played by BRC-20, 'runes' may need more gameplay to stimulate. If 'recursive runes' can be quickly implemented, it will undoubtedly be a strong boost for 'runes'.","The floor price of Blob has risen by 30%, breaking through 0.04 Bitcoin. @Elocremarc has announced the introduction of'recursive runes' on the Ordinals protocol.

2024-04-23,"According to U.Today, Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has recently engaged in a discussion about the control of hash power within the Bitcoin network. Schwartz has challenged the prevailing belief that the majority of hash power determines who gets to use the name 'Bitcoin'. This discourse was initiated in response to a user named 'Curtis Ellis' who shared his understanding of 'BTC logic' on a platform. According to Ellis, the majority of hash power decides who gets to use the name Bitcoin and users must run a full node to follow the hash power that runs the rules they choose. In the Bitcoin network, participants, or the computers that maintain the Bitcoin blockchain, are known as nodes. These nodes are classified into full and miner nodes. Full nodes store an entire copy of the blockchain and validate blocks and transactions to ensure they follow network rules. They are crucial to the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network. The Nakamoto consensus, which includes the longest chain rule, has been the backbone of the Bitcoin network. This rule states that the chain with the highest total computing effort is the legitimate blockchain when competing chains occur on a network. However, Schwartz has brought a new perspective to this discussion. He questions whether the majority of hash power truly gives the authority to define what 'Bitcoin' is. He cites the example of the Bitcoin cash hard fork from Bitcoin, which took place in 2017. Schwartz argues that rational users did not simply choose whichever side was called 'Bitcoin' after the fork. He suggests that the rule for determining which side is 'Bitcoin' does not necessarily guide users to the side they want to be on. This intervention by the Ripple CTO has added a nuanced perspective to the discussion, challenging the community to critically think about the principles that underpin the ecosystem.",David Schwartz has challenged the prevailing belief that the majority of hash power determines who gets to use the name 'Bitcoin'.

On April 17, the price of Bitcoin fell below the $60,000 level, just days before the halving. This drop was partially attributed to the decreasing likelihood of a June rate cut, based on the most recent inflation data.

2024-04-23,"According to U.Today, the cost of mining Bitcoin is on the rise, with the recent reward halving making it more expensive for miners. CoinShares reports that it now costs approximately $53,000 to mine a single Bitcoin, an average amount spent by large mining companies. The term 'halving' refers to the process where miners receive half the Bitcoin they used to for decoding blocks containing data about the Bitcoin network. As a result, the cost of operating their mining machines, primarily electricity, could effectively feel like it has doubled. Experts predict that the total power required for Bitcoin mining could increase to 700 Exahash by 2025, indicating a significant increase in the power needed to run the Bitcoin network. However, following the halving, less profitable mining machines may be switched off, potentially reducing this number by around 10%. Despite the challenges, there are potential solutions. Some miners are relocating to areas where they can access cheaper, often wasted energy, such as gas that would otherwise be burned off. Additionally, the use of AI in countries where energy is stable and affordable is becoming more prevalent. This could be a game-changer, potentially fueling the network in the future. Post-halving, the cost of mining a Bitcoin could increase even further. Miners' expenses, such as electricity and equipment, might almost double on paper, while the price for Kw/h remains the same. To cope with this, miners are seeking better deals on their equipment and cheaper power sources.

2024-04-23,"According to Blockworks, a recent report by PayPal's internal research group suggests that economic incentives could encourage bitcoin miners to adopt cleaner energy sources. Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has been criticized for its high computational intensity, which has raised environmental concerns. The report proposes a solution that involves offering additional bitcoin rewards to miners who use low-carbon energy sources. Under the PoW mechanism, bitcoin miners are compensated with bitcoin for their computational work. The report suggests that a small additional amount of bitcoin could be allocated to miners who prioritize environmentally friendly practices. The proposed program would begin by identifying 'green miners' who use clean energy or have a minimal impact on energy grids. These miners would be identified by their public keys, referred to as 'green keys'. To incentivize these green miners, certain bitcoin transactions would include a UTXO with a multisig wallet containing extra bitcoin. This wallet could only be accessed by green keys. These transactions would also feature lower-than-average fees, making them more attractive to green miners. The report likens this approach to providing an 'indirect grant' to bitcoin miners who use cleaner energy. However, the report acknowledges potential drawbacks. For instance, miners who do not prioritize green practices could still pick up transactions earmarked for green miners if the low fees are not a deterrent. The report also suggests measures to prevent 'malicious green miners' from driving up transaction fees on green transactions for personal gain. The report does not specify the amount of the 'subsidy', only stating that the green miner multisig would contain 'some bitcoins'. If the public mempool solution proposed by PayPal is not effective, the report suggests that smart contracts or the Lightning Network could be used to privately reward green miners. This would, however, require a level of trust. The report was produced by PayPal's Blockchain Research Group, which has been operational since around 2015.

2024-04-23,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, recently discussed the potential impact of Bitcoin halving on the cryptocurrency's supply and price. He anticipates a supply shock and the emergence of 'Omega candles', which could potentially push Bitcoin's value to $1 million. Mow explained the concept of Bitcoin halving to Forbes. The total Bitcoin supply of 21 million coins is gradually introduced to the market by miners in the form of block rewards. This system was designed by Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to occur every four years, with each halving reducing the rewards by 50%. Halvings occur after every 210,000 blocks are generated by miners. This mechanism was implemented to prevent an oversupply of Bitcoin in the market. Initially, miners earned 50 BTC for each new block. Without the four previous halvings, all 21 million Bitcoins would have already been mined. The CEO further highlighted that the approval of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in January sparked new demand for Bitcoin. Companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck were among those who received approval. Mow believes that the combination of reduced block rewards due to halving and the increased demand from these ETFs could lead to a Bitcoin supply shock. Mow also predicted the occurrence of 'Omega candles' in the future. These are large trading candles that signify high volatility and significant price changes. He stated that the daily demand for Bitcoin was already 5-10 times the supply before the halving, making the emergence of Omega candles seem inevitable. Bitcoin halvings are generally seen as bullish indicators for the cryptocurrency market. They not only prove the effectiveness of the Bitcoin protocol but also contribute to Bitcoin's scarcity, drawing it closer to gold.

2024-04-22,"According to U.Today, Martti Malmi, an early contributor to Bitcoin, has recently made public a series of previously undisclosed emails exchanged with the mysterious Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. These emails provide fresh insights into the early days of Bitcoin and Nakamoto's philosophical approach to the digital currency. A key revelation from these emails is Nakamoto's view of Bitcoin as primarily a medium of exchange, rather than just an investment tool. Nakamoto highlighted the energy efficiency of Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism in comparison to traditional banking systems, addressing environmental concerns before they became a significant issue. An email dated May 2, 2009, shows Nakamoto praising Malmi for understanding Bitcoin's potential. He suggested that linking Bitcoin to fiat currencies could enhance its value, a topic he was reluctant to discuss publicly until the right time. Nakamoto also emphasized the need to prepare for a surge in users, predicting widespread adoption. Moreover, Nakamoto foresaw Bitcoin's capacity to scale up to handle transaction volumes much larger than those managed by traditional financial systems, and at a fraction of the cost. He assured that as the network expanded, it would become more secure, dismissing early vulnerabilities as minor startup issues. Interestingly, the emails also reveal Nakamoto's request for assistance with website content, demonstrating his willingness to collaborate and delegate tasks. Discussions also revolved around Bitcoin-like encryption, backups, and user-friendliness, indicating Nakamoto's commitment to making Bitcoin accessible and secure for the masses. These email exchanges add depth to the narrative around Satoshi Nakamoto and the origins of Bitcoin, offering intriguing details that could potentially shed more light on Nakamoto's secret identity.

2024-04-22,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin generated a record $78.3 million in fees on April 20, significantly outpacing Ethereum's $3.2 million. This surge in fees followed the launch of Bitcoin Runes by the creators of Ordinals after the halving event. The protocol allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the leading blockchain. Lucas Outumuro, a researcher at IntoTheBlock, described the launch of Runes as 'absolutely insane.' He noted that the $80 million in daily fees is about four times larger than the previous all-time high set in December 2017. During the ordinals, the average transaction fee was $30, but it has now peaked at $128. Despite the recent halving event, which saw block rewards drop by 50%, miners are now earning record revenues. On Saturday, they earned more than $100 million. This is a significant shift from the previous consensus that miners would face short-term strain following the halving, with prominent miners' stocks dropping more than 50% from their record highs. Outumuro suggested that traditional finance was not aware of the launch of Runes. 'It's been less than 48 hours since the launch of Runes and it has already made an impact of historic proportions,' he said. However, it remains to be seen whether the hype surrounding Runes will continue. So far, retail appears to be sitting on the sidelines, as the number of retail addresses has reached a new low.

2024-04-22,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has been in a consolidation phase for the past few weeks following its inability to surpass the $75K mark. However, this trend may be on the verge of changing. On the daily chart, Bitcoin's price remains confined between the $60K and $68K levels, with no significant breakout on either side. In recent days, however, the bulls have made substantial strides, pushing the Bitcoin price closer to the $68K mark. A breakout above this level could potentially trigger a continuation. Conversely, a breakdown below the $60K level could have disastrous consequences, potentially causing the price to plummet to as low as $52K in a short time. The 4-hour chart reveals a shift in the price structure following a retest of the $60K support zone. The market is making higher highs and lows, pushing towards the $68K resistance level. The Relative Strength Index has also climbed above the 50% mark, suggesting that momentum is favoring a rally towards $68K in the short term. While Bitcoin's price shows signs of recovery, market participants are questioning whether the bull market will persist. Some may even be seeking an explanation for why the price rally halted at $75K. The 30-day moving average of the Bitcoin miner outflow metric, which tracks the number of transactions sent from Bitcoin miners' wallets, could provide some insight. Increases in this metric are typically linked to high selling pressure. It's clear that miner outflows surged rapidly in January and February, contributing to the price correction. However, this metric is now declining as outflows from miner wallets decrease.

These tokens have seen a surge of 5% to 20% since the event, outpacing the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The market cap for Bitcoin layer 2 solutions stands at $4.3 billion, marking a 5.6% increase in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $184 million. Stacks (STX), a Bitcoin layer 2 solution, has been among the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. The STX token has surged almost 20% to $2.87 since the halving event. In contrast, Bitcoin has not seen significant growth, with the token up slightly over 4.5% to $66,046 since the halving event, 1.7% over the last 24 hours, and down 0.8% over the last 7 days. Bitcoin’s price experienced significant volatility last week, dropping from over $66,800 to below $60,000, but has since recovered. Other layer 2 tokens, such as Elastos’ ELA token and SatoshiVM’s SAVM, have also seen gains of 11% and 5%, respectively, since the halving. Other altcoins have observed slight daily gains, except for TON, which has experienced a significant double-digit decline despite Tether’s announcement of expanding to the TON blockchain. Bitcoin layer 2 solutions address blockchain scalability and transaction speed limitations by operating on the Bitcoin blockchain and processing transactions off the main chain.

This figure is over six times higher than the average fee rate the day prior and approximately double the previous record set three years ago. The fee surge can be attributed to the launch of the Runes protocol, which enables users to “etch” and mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The introduction of Runes prompted speculators to rush into minting tokens and trading meme coins, leading to increased transaction activity and, subsequently, higher transaction costs.

This comes after a significant capital withdrawal from its primary GBTC product. To compete with its ten competitors, Grayscale has proposed a smaller Bitcoin ETF with highly competitive fees. Grayscale's new ETF, the Bitcoin Mini Trust, has set fees at a mere 0.15%, according to its recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On April 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas responded to the news, stating that Grayscale's mini-BTC would have a fee of 15bps, potentially making it the most affordable BTC ETF on the market. However, he clarified that this is still hypothetical and does not guarantee a fund fee of 15bps. The existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust charges a 1.5% fee, which is one of the reasons it has lost a significant portion of its assets under management compared to lower-fee competitor funds. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) is currently the closest competitor to the new fund, with fees at 0.19%. When the Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) is launched, the company will transfer 10% of the GBTC assets to the new fund, according to the filing. This could amount to approximately 30,500 BTC, worth around $2 billion. However, if GBTC continues to experience steady outflows until the mini-BTC fund is launched, this figure is likely to be lower. Shares of the new fund will be automatically issued and distributed to GBTC shareholders. Since converting to a spot ETF in mid-January, GBTC has lost over 50% of its BTC holdings.

The upgrade is expected to speed up block processing and finalize all settlements on the layer-1, allowing Bitcoin to maintain its security while becoming programmable, akin to Ethereum and Solana Virtual Machines. Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, believes that the Nakamoto upgrade and the overall expansion of Bitcoin layer-2 infrastructure could reignite interest in the Bitcoin blockchain. Ali stated that users are now distinguishing between BTC as an asset and Bitcoin as a platform. He noted that BTC has established itself as a hedge or store of value, resulting in nearly $1 trillion in idle capital. Ali credits advancements like the Nakamoto upgrade for this resurgence. The Stacks team anticipates that the Nakamoto upgrade rollout will continue over the next month, reducing block times from the current 10-30 minutes to approximately five seconds.

2024-04-22,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin miner Hut 8's diversified revenue streams could potentially give it a long-term advantage over its competitors, as per analysts at Benchmark. The research firm began covering the stock three days after the Bitcoin halving, when per-block rewards decreased from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Senior equity research analyst at Benchmark, Mark Palmer, assigned Hut 8 a buy rating and a price target of $12, approximately 50% higher than its current trading level. Hut 8's 2025 enterprise value-to-revenue multiple is 2.6, compared to the average 3.1 multiple of its competitors, based on Benchmark data. This research considered the multiples of Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, CleanSpark, Bitfarms, Cipher Mining, Iris Energy, Hive Digital Technologies, and TeraWulf. The figures are based on consensus 2025 revenue estimates, and the enterprise values include the companies’ net debt balances. Palmer stated that Hut 8 is expected to close the valuation gap with listed peers that are further along in boosting their self-mining capacity as it executes on the build-out of its platform. Investors are currently focused on self-mining due to expectations that the price of bitcoin will rally aggressively following the latest halving. Hut 8’s self-mining deployed hash rate is 5.4 exahash per second (EH/s), lagging behind some of the space’s largest players. However, Palmer believes that the diversity of Hut 8’s platform will benefit it over the long-term, as its revenue streams outside of self-mining position it to weather severe downturns in bitcoin’s price better than most of its listed peers. This comes after Hut 8 and US Bitcoin Corp. underwent a “merger of equals” that closed in November. The combined company has business lines focused on managed services, hosting, high-performance computing, and AI. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has stated that he is examining every business line to identify and eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs. The company recently energized a third of its 63 MW Salt Creek site in Culberson County, TX, relocating miners from its Kearney, NE and Granbury, TX sites. Genoot believes that this move will provide control over their miner fleet and operating costs. Despite the need for more efficiency upgrades in Hut 8’s mining fleet, Palmer noted that its holdings of 9,102 BTC give it a solid liquidity cushion and the ability to capture upside during bitcoin price rallies. He concluded that the company’s diversified model and relative strength in bitcoin’s price should support its operating performance until new equipment is purchased and deployed.","Bitcoin miner Hut 8's diversified revenue streams could give it a long-term advantage over its competitors.

2024-04-22,"According to Bloomberg, a historic sign that became a symbol for Bitcoin supporters is set to be auctioned. The sign, which was displayed behind then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen during a Congressional testimony in 2017, was created by Christian Langalis, a 22-year-old Bitcoin owner and intern at the Libertarian think tank Cato Institute. After the sign was caught on television, Langalis was escorted out of the hearing but received about seven Bitcoin in unsolicited donations. At the time, Bitcoin was gaining public attention, trading at around $2,300, up from less than $1,000 six months earlier. The cryptocurrency surged more than 13,000% in 2017, only to crash 74% the following year. This boom-and-bust cycle has become a common pattern for the digital asset. With Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity now supporting the token, Langalis is looking to capitalize on the current momentum that saw Bitcoin reach a record high of almost $74,000 in March. In 2019, Langalis sold 21 replica editions of the sign for an average realized price of 0.8 Bitcoin. These replicas, numbered and time-stamped, were created by Langalis himself. Recently, Langalis was offered five Bitcoin for the original sign, currently worth around $330,000, but decided to auction it instead. The auction materials describe the item as an 'Ink Drawing on Legal Pad' weighing half a pound, which also contains Langalis's notes from the hearing. The page with the sign drawing was removed from the notepad shortly after the hearing and has since been reattached with clear archival wire.

2024-04-21,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the former Chief Security Officer at Blockstream and current CEO at Bitcoin-adoption company Jan3, has announced the arrival of the much-anticipated fourth Bitcoin halving, which he refers to as the '4th Bitcoin quantitative hardening.' This term is used in contrast to the quantitative easing frequently implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which involves injecting billions of dollars into the economy, a move that many experts believe is causing the U.S. dollar to devalue. Experts suggest that these quantitative easing measures were a significant factor in driving the Bitcoin price above $61,500 in April 2021 and then to an all-time high of $69,000 in November of the same year. In 2024, Bitcoin reached a new historic price peak of $73,750 in March, before the halving, a first for the cryptocurrency. Halving events reduce the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation as miners' block rewards. Following this halving, the rewards were cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, where they will remain for the next four years until the fifth halving. Mow commented on this aspect of the halving, stating that any Bitcoin owned before this moment is now twice as hard for miners to procure for the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,913. Mow also noted that Bitcoin continues to outperform gold, its physical rival traditionally considered a store of value. After the halving, Bitcoin's inflation rate will drop to 0.9%, while gold's will remain at 1.4%. As Anthony Pompliano stated in a recent CNBC interview, those who have held gold over the past five years have lost purchasing power, unlike Bitcoin holders.","The fourth Bitcoin halving is taking place today.

2024-04-21,"According to U.Today, the Bitcoin community recently celebrated the completion of another halving event. This software update, which took effect at 8:10 p.m. Friday, New York time, reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half. Many view this event as a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency's value. However, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff offers a contrasting perspective. Schiff, a long-time skeptic of Bitcoin and advocate for gold, warns that the halving may not necessarily lead to the anticipated price increase. He suggests that Bitcoin holders may experience a 'halving' of their net worth, implying a potential price drop. Schiff expressed his views via a tweet, 'Congratulations, Bitcoiners, on the Halving. Are you guys commemorating this occasion by throwing parties tonight? I haven't been invited to any. I think halving is an appropriate name for what's happening as soon Bitcoin hodlers experience a halving of their net worths.' As Bitcoin enters a new phase following the completion of its latest halving event, the debate over its future trajectory continues. Before the halving event, on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock highlighted the trend of BTC price performance following each Bitcoin halving. They noted that a bullish trend often emerges and lasts about a year. Additionally, miners' BTC holdings reached a 12-year low, suggesting that miners had been net sellers before the halving.

2024-04-21,"According to U.Today, renowned investor Anthony Scaramucci has recently shared his perspective on the future price of Bitcoin in relation to the halving event that took place last Friday. During his latest appearance on Wealthion, Scaramucci, a long-standing advocate for cryptocurrency, emphasized the substantial demand for Bitcoin. This demand is largely driven by investors purchasing into ETFs such as BlackRock and Kathy Wood's funds, while the network only generates 450 coins daily. Scaramucci noted that this demand often leads to a surge in prices. However, following the halving event, prices usually drop. He explained that this is due to many short-term Bitcoin holders selling after making profits, while new investors enter the market. Scaramucci stressed his personal strategy of holding Bitcoin for the long term, regardless of price fluctuations. He cited Bitcoin's robust performance over the past 14 years as proof of its value. Scaramucci advised against viewing Bitcoin as a lottery ticket due to its volatility. Instead, he encouraged people to invest in it to become part of the revolution. He suggested starting with a small investment to understand Bitcoin's technical properties and experience the thrill of being involved in the cryptocurrency space. Previously, Scaramucci expressed his views on the future price of Bitcoin. He anticipates a potential valuation increase of up to 10 times from the current level, which could reach $6-8 million. Despite this optimistic forecast, Scaramucci stated that Bitcoin is currently neither a strong inflation hedge nor a fully established store of value. He attributed this to the relatively low global adoption of the coin, suggesting that significant changes would not occur until Bitcoin attracts at least a billion users, a milestone he expects around 2026.","Anthony Scaramucci has shared his views on the future price of Bitcoin in relation to the halving event that took place last Friday.

2024-04-21,"According to CoinDesk: Contrary to expectations, Bitcoin’s “halving” event didn’t slash revenues for Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies. Thanks to the simultaneous launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol, transaction fees surged, resulting in higher profits for Bitcoin miners. The debut of Runes protocol drove up Bitcoin transaction fees to record levels. (BitInfoCharts) Bitcoin’s notable “halving” procedure, which took place recently, was anticipated to severely reduce Bitcoin miners’ earnings, with rewards for creating new data blocks halved. Nevertheless, the rollout of the new Runes protocol, which caters to minting digital tokens on the pioneering and most vast blockchain, has been so well-received that it led to significant network congestion. This spike in activity paved the way for transaction fees to reach record levels, offering Bitcoin (BTC) miners extremely high returns. Bitcoin transaction fees peaked at an average of $127.97 on April 20. That's more than seven times higher than the previous day and approximately double the previous record from three years ago. As a result, the total revenue for Bitcoin miners, factoring both block rewards and transaction fees, soared to a record single-day total of $107.8 million. This development looks promising for major Bitcoin mining companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA), Riot Blockchain ($RIOT), Hut 8 Mining (HUT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). As Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto originally designed, the periodic halvings are an effort to protect Bitcoin from inflation. As the rewards for miners decrease, the question arises – will there be sufficient incentives for miners to continue operating on the blockchain, considering their crucial role to the blockchain network's security. Bitcoin mining revenue shot to a record $107.8 million on April 20 after the launch of the Runes protocol. (YCharts) According to Ten31, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, concerns about Bitcoin’s long-term 'security budget' are misplaced.

2024-04-20,"According to Bloomberg, the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event took place recently, reducing the mining reward by half. This event, which occurs every four years, is designed to limit the number of Bitcoins in circulation to a maximum of 21 million, as per the original cryptocurrency's code. The halving mechanism was introduced by Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to prevent inflation. The halving event, which was the fourth since 2012, reduced the daily reward for miners from 900 to 450 Bitcoins. Despite the reduction, Bitcoin advocates remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency's future. However, market watchers have noted that the halving was already factored into the price, resulting in limited price movement. The impact of Bitcoin mining on the total number of tokens in circulation decreases with each halving. For instance, the number of tokens mined after the first halving represented 50% of the total Bitcoins at the time, while the new supply in the upcoming cycle will only account for 3.3%. The halving event is expected to have a more significant impact on Bitcoin mining companies than on the cryptocurrency's price. Bitcoin mining, which is an energy-intensive process, involves using specialized computers to validate transactions on the blockchain. Large-scale miners are expected to consolidate, with publicly-traded firms gaining market share due to their greater access to funding and ability to invest in more efficient equipment. The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled for 2028, reducing the reward for miners to 1.5625 from 3.125 for successfully processing a block of transaction data. Once the 21 million cap is reached, miners will have to rely on transaction fees, which currently constitute a small portion of their total revenue.","The Bitcoin halving event took place recently, reducing the daily reward for miners from 900 to 450 Bitcoins.

Increased interest, triggered by predictions of a post-halving market value rise, facilitated the inflow into five of the 10 approved ETFs, overruling the outflows primarily from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). Spot Bitcoin ETF net flows. Source: Farside  These inflows, coupled with $54.8 million from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) just before the Bitcoin halving event, totaled to a positive net of $30.4 million in the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market.

The rise in Bitcoin investment in ETFs mirrored the cryptocurrency's considerable value appreciation from about $8,500 during May 2020's halving event, to around $65,000 within four years.

2024-04-20,"According to U.Today, in a recent interview, renowned venture capitalist Tim Draper has made a bold prediction about the future of Bitcoin. He believes that the cryptocurrency's price could potentially skyrocket to $10 million. Draper suggests that this could happen when Bitcoin becomes a universally accepted form of payment for everyday necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, as well as taxes. He believes that once this happens, people will not want to use any other currency. Draper, who has a reputation for his early investments in companies like Skype, also anticipates a devaluation of the U.S. dollar against Bitcoin. He also spoke about the upcoming halving event, predicting that it will trigger another surge in the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. It's important to note that this halving cycle is unique because Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high before the block reward reduction, largely due to the success of spot ETFs. Draper referred to these ETFs as an 'accelerant' that he hadn't anticipated. Draper, an early Bitcoin investor, had previously accurately predicted that Bitcoin would surpass $10,000 in 2017. He has also repeatedly forecasted that Bitcoin would hit $250,000 in 2022, a prediction that turned out to be incorrect. Draper admitted that his overconfidence may have led to this inaccurate prediction, and he also blamed heavy-handed regulators for slowing down the progress of Bitcoin. He had expected Bitcoin payments to become widespread in 2022, but this did not happen. 'Those are the two things that slowed down the progress,' he concluded.","Tim Draper predicts that Bitcoin's price could rise to $10 million once Bitcoin is accepted as a universally accepted form of payment for everyday necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.

2024-04-20,"According to U.Today, renowned trader Peter Brandt has hinted at a significant price move for Bitcoin in a recent social media post. Brandt identified a recurring pattern in Bitcoin's market behavior, which he breaks down into three phases: Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump. This characterization captures the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price movements. The current cycle has completed the two phases of hump-slump and bump-rump, with the third phase, pump-dump, still ongoing. The 'dump' part of this phase has been fulfilled, leaving the 'pump' part yet to occur. Brandt's hint comes at a time of increased volatility and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin experiencing price drops. The potential for a major price move, as suggested by Brandt, adds intrigue to Bitcoin's price trajectory. Adding to this intrigue is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, a phenomenon that historically impacts the price of Bitcoin. Halving reduces the reward for mining new blocks, effectively decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. This event has previously led to increased demand and a subsequent price rise, aligning with Brandt's suggestion of a major move ahead. Analysts from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank believe that the halving, which has long been touted as a major bullish factor for the Bitcoin price, has already been priced in. They stated in a note that the biggest impact will be on Bitcoin mining rather than its price. The exact timing and magnitude of the anticipated move remain unclear, but traders and investors are closely monitoring the market for further indicators that could suggest Bitcoin's next move. Bitcoin recovered after falling sharply to intraday lows of $59,573. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 5.13% in the last 24 hours to $64,641 as selling by traders seemed to ease.","Peter Brandt has hinted at a significant price move for Bitcoin in a recent social media post.

2024-04-20,"According to U.Today, a recent analysis by crypto analyst Rekt Capital has highlighted the possible timeline for Bitcoin's (BTC) next bull market peak. The analysis emphasizes the significant influence of the halving cycle on BTC’s market trajectory. Historically, Bitcoin tends to reach its bull market peak between 518 and 546 days following a halving event. Based on this pattern, the next bull market peak is projected to occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025. However, current market trends suggest that Bitcoin's present cycle may be moving faster than previous ones. The Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high approximately 260 days ahead of the typical schedule. Despite this acceleration, Bitcoin has experienced a pre-halving retrace over the past month. This retrace has resulted in a slowdown in the cycle, pushing the timeline to about 230 days ahead of schedule, rather than the previously observed 260 days. This slowdown has extended the bull market cycle by approximately 30 days so far. Rekt Capital also proposed an 'Accelerated Perspective' that takes into account the time from when Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high to the potential bull market peak. Under this perspective, the peak could be expected between 266 and 315 days after surpassing the previous all-time high. Considering that BTC hit new all-time highs in March, this perspective suggests that the next bull market peak might occur between December 2024 and February 2025. Both the traditional halving cycle timeline and the Accelerated Perspective provide valuable insights into Bitcoin's potential bull market peak. The current acceleration in the cycle suggests that the typical halving cycle length could be halved, potentially leading to an earlier market peak. However, the impact of retracements and consolidations on the overall cycle must be considered. Extended periods of retracement or consolidation could further slow down the cycle, delaying the expected bull market peak. As Bitcoin continues its current market cycle, these key factors are being closely monitored to gain a clearer understanding of when the next bull market peak might occur.","The next bull market peak is projected to occur between mid-September and mid-October 2025.

Greeks.live reports that 21,564 BTC options are nearing expiration, with a Put Call Ratio of 0.64, suggesting a higher number of put options compared to call options.

Pompliano also discussed the impact of Bitcoin's rise on the market value of gold over the past five years. During his interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box show, Pompliano stated that despite the significant pullback seen over the weekend, Bitcoin has been performing exceptionally well. He noted that a few years ago, investors dreamed of Bitcoin reaching $64,000, and now it has increased by approximately 40% year-to-date. Since the last halving four years ago, Bitcoin has risen by 800%, from $8,000 to $64,000, a performance Pompliano described as strong and remarkable. Pompliano also criticized gold, traditionally considered a store of value. He pointed out that over the past five years, gold has only increased by about 11% and is up just 7% year-to-date in 2024. He argued that those who held gold over the past five years have lost purchasing power as inflation has outpaced gold's performance. Pompliano claimed that the narrative of gold as a protector of purchasing power has been debunked, while Bitcoin has proven its worth in this regard over the past five years. Pompliano also discussed the reasons behind Bitcoin's rise this year. He cited the buying spree of spot Bitcoin ETFs, investors buying Bitcoin in anticipation of the halving and subsequent price surge, and the debasement of the U.S. dollar due to the U.S. government's national debt problem.

The growing US government debt has garnered more attention, with interest payments occupying a larger proportion, sometimes even exceeding defense spending. This deteriorating trend has driven demand for Bitcoin and gold, which are often used as tools to hedge against inflation and the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar. Brad Bechtel, Global Head of Foreign Exchange at Jefferies, stated that concerns about the US debt cycle and the devaluation of legal currency have driven the narrative for Bitcoin and gold, leading investors to allocate more to these assets. Lawrence H. White, an economics professor at George Mason University, believes that interest in Bitcoin and gold also stems from intensified inflation turbulence. More worryingly, debt and deficits are still rising in times of peace and full employment, which could trigger a larger increase in debt during the next recession. In addition to hedging risks, the rise in Bitcoin prices is also influenced by the launch of new ETFs and the upcoming halving event. Gold, on the other hand, has reached a historic high due to expectations of interest rate cuts by central banks and the demand for diversification of foreign reserves. Despite this, the rapid deterioration of the US fiscal situation remains a major concern for some investors. Market strategist Michael Hartnett pointed out that the recent highs in gold and tech stocks indicate that the US may have to adopt policies such as yield curve control to prevent a debt crisis. However, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, stated that several indicators in the current Treasury market show that bonds have not yet reflected the expected deterioration in fiscal prospects. Investors still regard the dollar as a reserve currency and US bonds as relatively safe assets. If seeking large-scale risk-free assets, the US bond market remains the first choice.","The US government debt has risen from $5 trillion to $27 trillion since 2007.

2024-04-18,"According to CryptoPotato, two of the largest banks in the United States, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, are advising cryptocurrency investors to exercise caution ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Analysts predict that this halving may not follow the patterns of previous cycles. In a recent report, JPMorgan suggested that Bitcoin's price is unlikely to increase after the halving, and may instead continue the downward trend that began earlier this month. JPMorgan's perspective aligns with its consistently bearish forecasts throughout the year, remaining unswayed by the growing optimism surrounding Bitcoin spot ETFs or the halving. Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated, 'We do not expect bitcoin price increases post-halving as it has already been priced in. In fact, we see a downside for the bitcoin price post-halving for several reasons.' The analysts used the price of gold as a reference point, arguing that Bitcoin's price should only be $45,000 on a volatility-adjusted basis, indicating that its current market price of $63,700 is significantly overbought. This view is supported by a continuing long bias in Bitcoin futures open interest and a lack of venture funding in the crypto industry this year. Goldman Sachs, in a note to clients last week, acknowledged that Bitcoin's past three halving cycles have resulted in substantial price increases in the aftermath, although the exact time it took to reach a new all-time high afterward has varied greatly. This cycle appears even more different: Bitcoin already topped its previous cycle’s all-time high above $69,000 in March, one month before the halving even occurred. The analysts warned against extrapolating past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions. The halving itself is due later this week, expected on April 20 at 01:44 UTC. Regardless of whether it results in a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' event in the short term, Goldman believes BTC’s immediate price action is hardly relevant. 'Bitcoin price performance will likely continue to be driven by the said supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for bitcoin ETFs, which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action,' the bank said.","JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs advise Bitcoin investors to exercise caution ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving.

2024-04-18,"According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG have stated that the Bitcoin software update known as the 'halving', which occurs every four years, is largely factored into the cryptocurrency's current value. The analysts from these banks believe that the main impact of this event will be on Bitcoin mining rather than its price. As unprofitable miners leave the Bitcoin network, the sector is expected to consolidate, with publicly-traded companies best positioned to gain market share. JPMorgan analysts noted that publicly-listed Bitcoin miners are well equipped to benefit from the new environment, primarily due to their greater access to funding and equity financing. This allows them to expand their operations and invest in more efficient equipment. Deutsche Bank analysts also do not anticipate a significant increase in Bitcoin prices following the halving. They explained that the Bitcoin algorithm has already accounted for the halving, and this event has been factored into the market. The halving reduces the mining reward, a fixed amount of Bitcoin released from the network to compensate miners for validating its transactions, by half every four years. In the past, the total mining capacity of the industry, measured by the hashrate, generally falls after a Bitcoin halving as some miners are priced out of the market. Deutsche Bank noted that after the first three Bitcoin halvings, the hashrate dropped by 25%, 11%, and 25% respectively. Despite not expecting drastic price fluctuations, Deutsche Bank still expects Bitcoin prices to remain high due to expectations of spot Ethereum ETF approvals, central bank rate cuts, and regulatory changes. They also mentioned a surge in layer-2 solutions and DeFi activity, which enhance the network's practical utility, making the setup look remarkably favorable for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the wider crypto space. Currently, the US accounts for 40% of Bitcoin mining. However, both JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank agree that it is likely that some Bitcoin mining firms would look to diversify into 'low energy cost regions' such as Latin America or Africa post-halving to locate their inefficient mining supply and gain salvage values from those rigs which would otherwise sit idle.","JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG have stated that the 'halving' is largely factored into Bitcoin's current value.

2024-04-18,"According to U.Today, Charlie Shrem, a Bitcoin pioneer and co-creator of the Bitcoin Foundation, recently shared his recollections of the first Bitcoin halving in 2012 on a social media platform. Shrem revealed that he and his colleagues were concerned about the success of the first halving, despite outwardly appearing confident. In November 2012, the reward for mining a new block was reduced from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. Shrem, along with Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver, were among the early Bitcoin adopters who were unsure if the halving would work as intended. This week, the global Bitcoin community is anticipating the fourth Bitcoin halving, which will decrease block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for miners. Each halving event enhances Bitcoin's deflationary feature, making it more scarce as the remaining amount of the 21 million supply is mined more slowly every four years. This allows for a smaller amount of new BTC to be introduced into the market. The last Bitcoin is expected to be mined in 2140. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value has been on a downward trend for almost a week, since Friday, April 12. It has lost more than 10% of its value, despite two major attempts to recover. Bitcoin was trading close to $71,000 on that day, but at the time of writing, it is valued at $63,513. The recent drop in Bitcoin's value is believed to be due to negative geopolitical developments in the Middle East and comments from Fed Reserve chairman Jerome Powell about inflation being stronger than previously assessed. As a result, the likelihood of the Fed reducing interest rates has significantly decreased, which is unfavorable for risk assets, including Bitcoin.","Charlie Shrem shares his recollections of the first Bitcoin halving in 2012 on a social media platform.

2024-04-17,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin's recent 16.65% price drop has caused concern among traders, especially with the fourth halving of the cryptocurrency just days away. However, data analysis firm CryptoQuant suggests that this is not an anomaly, but a typical pre-halving price fluctuation observed in previous halving cycles. Historically, significant price collapses have occurred before each halving cycle. For example, before the second halving, Bitcoin's price dropped by 40.36%, bottoming out at $465, before surging to an all-time high of $19,600. Similarly, before the third halving, there was a 20.35% decrease, with Bitcoin's price reaching $8,078 before climbing to an astounding peak of $69,000. In the context of the current halving cycle, the recent 16.65% decrease in Bitcoin's price is well within the expected range of pre-halving fluctuations. This pattern, although it may vary in percentages, has consistently repeated itself across each halving cycle. Therefore, CryptoQuant suggests there is no need for undue alarm or panic. Despite the recent price decline, CryptoQuant remains optimistic about the future prospects of Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole. The path to the current cycle's peak is still open, and according to CryptoQuant, the market is still at the beginning of this journey. This perspective underscores the importance of a long-term investment strategy and the need to remain patient and informed amid market fluctuations. In conclusion, while the recent 16.65% decline in Bitcoin's price may have caused concern and uncertainty on the crypto market, historical data and insights suggest that this is a typical and anticipated pre-halving price fluctuation. Understanding these patterns and maintaining a strategic and informed approach can empower investors to navigate the market with confidence and resilience.","Bitcoin's recent 16.65% price drop has caused concern among traders.

Schiff, who is known for his skepticism towards Bitcoin, has challenged Novogratz's prediction that the influx of buyers through Bitcoin ETFs will significantly increase the digital asset's value. Novogratz had suggested that many Bitcoin ETF buyers, who are new to the crypto space, would act as long-term holders. However, Schiff dismissed this idea, describing them as opportunistic traders instead. He suggested that these 'Johnny-come-lately' buyers lack the conviction of true Bitcoin believers and are merely testing the waters. Schiff also implied that these investors would likely be the first to leave if the market conditions become unfavorable. Schiff's skepticism also extends to the broader implications for Bitcoin-related equities. He highlighted the downturn in various Bitcoin-related stocks, including Coinbase's COIN, GLXY, MSTR, WGMI, MARA, BITF, and HIVE. He questioned why these assets are struggling despite the purported bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. Schiff's critique adds to the ongoing debate over Bitcoin's future trajectory and the potential impact of institutional investment vehicles like ETFs.

2024-04-17,"According to U.Today, the S&P 500 has recently closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time in five months. This event, considered one of the most bullish for the U.S. stock market this year, could potentially impact Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. The correlation between the stock market and Bitcoin is largely due to investor sentiment. When significant stock indexes like the S&P 500 experience a downturn, it can cause investors across all markets to become apprehensive. This nervousness might lead them to reconsider their investments in perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin's price is at a crucial juncture, grappling with the $60,000 mark, a significant psychological level. If Bitcoin manages to maintain above this level and ascend further, the next key level to monitor would be around $67,000, a point where Bitcoin has previously faced resistance. However, if it drops below $60,000, the next support is expected around the $50,000 area, which could potentially cushion a falling price. In the past, Bitcoin has often moved independently, sometimes disregarding the stock market's performance. However, as more traditional stock investors venture into the crypto space, Bitcoin's price movements are beginning to mirror the stock market more closely. This connection suggests that a downturn in the stock market could lead to cautious trading in the cryptocurrency market. If the stock market continues to decline, Bitcoin might also feel the pressure. On the other hand, if the stock market recovers and begins to rise, it could provide Bitcoin with the momentum it needs to challenge its previous highs. The coming days could be critical as investors in both markets monitor these movements. The main takeaway is that the U.S. market's asset movements continue to significantly influence Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.","The S&P 500 has recently closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time in five months.

Saylor, who is now focused on the company's Bitcoin strategy, recently used his Twitter platform to discuss the significance of the halving event. In a tweet accompanied by a short video, Saylor stated, 'Bitcoin moves money forward.' The video illustrated the increasing number of pizzas one could buy with a single Bitcoin from its inception to the present day. The underlying message was that while traditional fiat currency has been depreciating over time, Bitcoin's value has been on the rise. Although the video did not explicitly mention the Bitcoin halving, it did note that 'every four years the future supply of Bitcoin is reduced.' With the Bitcoin halving just three days away, influencers are increasingly emphasizing the importance of this event for the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin halvings, which reduce the future supply of Bitcoin, have historically led to a surge in the cryptocurrency's price. For instance, Bitcoin reached an all-time high (ATH) of $20,000 in 2017 following the 2016 halving. Similarly, after the April 2020 halving, Bitcoin's price soared to a historic peak of $69,000. This year, Bitcoin achieved a new ATH of nearly $73,000 in March, even before the halving, largely due to a significant Bitcoin buying spree initiated by spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.

Collectively, these firms have slowed selling to a two-year low in Q1 2024, with approximately 2,000 BTC sold, as per the Bitwise report dated April 10.

This update, known as the 'halving', is scheduled to occur later this week and will drastically cut the rewards miners receive for validating transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoin mining is a process that requires substantial energy, where miners use specialized computers to validate transactions on the blockchain. In return, they earn a reward in the form of Bitcoin tokens. This reward, which constitutes the majority of mining revenue, is halved every four years due to a preprogrammed event known as the halving. The impending halving, the fourth since 2012, will decrease the Bitcoin reward from 900 to 450 tokens in daily production. In the face of this challenge, miners are hoping for increased demand from new spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) to push Bitcoin prices higher and offset the negative impact of the halving. The digital asset has seen a surge since traditional asset management firms launched these ETFs in January.

The wallet, which contains Bitcoin worth millions of dollars, was reactivated following Bitcoin's significant drop and subsequent partial recovery. The blockchain address, which holds 50 BTC valued at $3,314,211 at the time of the announcement, had been untouched for 14 years. The last Bitcoin activity in this wallet was in 2010, the year when Bitcoin's enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, decided to step back from Bitcoin and vanished, leaving his creation in the hands of a few dedicated developers. In recent months, several dormant cryptocurrency wallets, inactive for 10-14 years, have been noticed to awaken. These wallets hold early mined or purchased Bitcoin coins, as well as Ethereum acquired during the 2014 ICO. Typically, many holders choose to sell their old holdings after a decade, aiming to profit from the surge in BTC or ETH prices. However, in many instances, users only manage to recover their long-lost private keys by now. Over the past weekend, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop of more than 12%, falling from the recently regained $70,900 to $61,970. This drop is believed to be due to a new development in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin has since recovered by more than 7%, reaching $66,342 – the price at which it is currently trading.

2024-04-16,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will surpass the gold market cap once ETFs have completed their role. Woo suggests that the recently launched Bitcoin ETFs could potentially bring Bitcoin price targets to $91,000 at the bear market bottom and $650,000 at the bull market top. These targets, however, may not be achievable in this cycle due to the lengthy process of capital deployments. Woo's forecast is based on the assumption that the $100 trillion managed by asset managers typically has a 2% allocation recommendation. This would result in an estimated $2 trillion potential allocation into Bitcoin, a figure that Woo believes could increase over time. Currently, Bitcoin holds $561,159,959 of investment, according to on-chain data. An inflow of $2 trillion would raise this amount to over $2.56 trillion. Using the MVRV to calculate market cap versus money invested, which is a ratio of 5x in bull market tops and 0.7x in bear market bottoms, this would translate to market capitalizations of $12.8 trillion and $1.8 trillion, respectively. This would equate to $650,000 and $91,000 for the Bitcoin price in bull and bear market scenarios, respectively. Excluding other self-custody inflows, Woo is of the opinion that Bitcoin could indeed surpass gold capitalization by the time the asset manager capital is deployed. Given that gold experienced a 12-year bull run after its ETF was approved, Bitcoin may follow a similar trajectory. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.49% in the last 24 hours to $64,524. Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market has reached a three-year high, reflecting strong demand for U.S. exchange-traded funds that hold the largest digital asset, as well as a challenging era for smaller tokens.

2024-04-15,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a significant drop over the weekend, reaching lows of $60,822 before partially recovering to approximately $64,438. The exact reason for the market downturn remains uncertain, but some speculate that reduced liquidity may have contributed to the lower prices. In response to the market crash, seasoned trader Peter Brandt offered his perspective, suggesting that Bitcoin has completed an 'end run'. The term 'end run' typically refers to a strategic move that involves bypassing a challenge or obstacle. In the context of Bitcoin, it could suggest that the market has navigated a difficult situation due to its price crash near $60,000. Brandt's 'end run' comment might also hint at the completion of a specific pattern in Bitcoin's price movement. Brandt identified a pattern in the Bitcoin chart that resembles a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern usually indicates a period of consolidation before the price is compelled to break out or down. A breakdown from the lower trend line signals the beginning of a new bearish trend, while a breakout from the higher trend line signifies the start of a new bullish trend. In the chart, Brandt referred to the breakdown from this pattern as the 'end run'. Previously, Brandt had predicted that Bitcoin's bull run would peak at $200,000 by August or September 2025, revising his initial forecast of $120,000. His recent remarks might suggest that the recent price drop is a healthy correction within a larger positive trend, possibly indicating a sense of completion and readiness for the next phase of Bitcoin's price movement. However, without additional details, Brandt's assertion of the 'end run' being completed remains subject to interpretation.","Bitcoin's price dropped from $60,822 to approximately $64,438 over the weekend.

2024-04-15,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin recently underwent a flash crash, dropping to just above the $61,000 mark. This price is equivalent to approximately 26 ounces of gold, according to Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff. Schiff pointed out that two and a half years ago, one Bitcoin was equivalent to 37 ounces of gold. He views this 30% decrease as a clear indication of Bitcoin entering a bear market, especially when compared to the traditional safe-haven asset, gold. Schiff's past suggestions to choose gold over Bitcoin when the latter was trading below the $20,000 level have faced criticism. This is particularly true as Bitcoin's price, despite its volatility, is currently around the $65,000 level. Presently, the price of the digital gold is hovering above the crucial support level represented by the 200-day moving average, near $49,800. If Bitcoin's price remains above this line, it could suggest continued confidence among investors and a potential rebound. Resistance is seen around the $67,300 level. If this level is broken, it could negate the bearish sentiment and indicate a possible bullish reversal. In terms of growth scenarios, consolidation above the $61,000 level followed by a sustained push above the $67,300 resistance could see Bitcoin regain its upward momentum. Such a move would be key to challenging the bearish perspective and may suggest that Bitcoin's price in gold terms is not the only indicator of its market health. However, the comparison between Bitcoin and gold is more intricate than it may seem, as both assets serve different functions and respond differently to the market. Gold is more of a traditional safe haven asset, while Bitcoin offers more risk exposure and acts as a digital store of value.","Bitcoin's price has recently dropped to $61,000.

The 11-fund category lost $83 million in assets from April 8 to April 12, a significant decrease from the net inflows of $485 million the previous week. Since January 11, spot bitcoin ETFs have collectively received $12.5 billion in positive flows. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) was the only US BTC fund to consistently see outflows, with $767 million leaving last week. The negative net flows of GBTC were not fully offset by the asset-gathering leaders, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which brought in $487 million and $90 million, respectively.

2024-04-15,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price experienced a significant drop of $10,000, potentially due to the prospect of US rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. However, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of recovery, with an expected boost from the upcoming halving event. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu's Shibarium network has seen a substantial increase in daily transactions, indicating increased activity and potential for future growth. Despite a recent price drop, analysts remain optimistic about XRP, viewing the current situation as a buying opportunity with expectations for an upward trend. Bitcoin was valued at over $72K last week, but over the weekend, it fell below the $63K mark. This severe correction may have been triggered by external events impacting traditional finance. For instance, the US Federal Reserve hinted at a potential rate hike due to persistent inflation in the world's largest economy. Additionally, geopolitical tensions increased following Iran's launch of over 300 drones and missiles at Israel. Bitcoin's price was negatively affected by geopolitical concerns earlier in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. However, the asset recovered all losses within days, raising hopes for a similar recovery soon. As of April 15, Bitcoin has risen by 3% and crossed the $66,000 level. The upcoming halving event, which occurs approximately every four years and halves the rewards distributed to miners for validating blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, could potentially lead to a more significant uptick. Shiba Inu's valuation has also significantly dropped in recent days, but metrics related to its ecosystem have increased. Daily transactions on the layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, surpassed 200,000 at the end of last week, a 4,000% spike compared to the previous day. The figure stands at over 400,000 as of April 15, indicating increased activity on the network. Shibarium's progress is seen as a crucial factor that could trigger a bull run for the second-largest meme coin. Ripple's native token, XRP, dipped by around 13% on a weekly scale, briefly falling below the $0.50 mark. However, many analysts remain unfazed, with some viewing this as an ideal buy-the-dip opportunity. Some predict that XRP has reached a 'bouncing point' and forecast that it will appreciate against Bitcoin very soon. Others assume that XRP could soon climb to an all-time high of $4.","Bitcoin's price dropped by $10,000 over the weekend.

2024-04-15,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin miners are potentially facing losses exceeding $10 billion due to the imminent halving event, scheduled to occur in less than five days. The immediate reward for mining new blocks will be cut from 6.25 BTC to just 3.125 BTC per block. This halving is predicted to hit mining companies with above-average operational costs particularly hard. Historically, miners have managed to recover from the impact of block reward reductions due to the bull runs that followed each halving. As observed by Chainalysis, miners were actively building cash liquidity on the brink of the first two halvings in 2012 and 2016. However, this was not the case leading up to the third halving in 2020. Based on Bitcoin's performance following the two previous mining cycles, miners delayed liquidating their reserves as they anticipated higher prices. This time, the aggregate balance of mining pools has also decreased by over 20%, but the decline is significantly smaller compared to the first two halvings. The fact that Bitcoin's price managed to reach a new all-time high on the brink of halving allowed miners to feel more comfortable liquidating some holdings to prepare for the severe impact of the halving. In addition to the Bitcoin halving, miners also face increasing competition from artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan noted that power has become 'extraordinarily constrained' in the US. Tech giants like Amazon are willing to invest substantial amounts of money in data centers, making it more challenging for miners to secure new low-cost power contracts.",Bitcoin miners are potentially facing losses exceeding $10 billion due to the imminent halving event.

2024-04-15,"According to U.Today, despite the recent turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, Samson Mow, a prominent proponent of the '$1 million for Bitcoin' theory, remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future. His confidence in the cryptocurrency remains unshaken even after a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price, triggered by geopolitical tensions. Mow maintains a bullish stance, expressing his belief that Bitcoin has strong potential for future growth. The recent market downturn saw Bitcoin lose nearly 14% of its value, reaching a low of $60,660, its lowest level in almost a month. Altcoins experienced even greater losses, with the TOTAL 2 index indicating a 22% decrease in total capitalization, equivalent to approximately $250 billion. Despite these losses, Mow's confidence in Bitcoin remains steadfast. He continues to assert his bullish stance on the flagship cryptocurrency, even in the face of the recent market downturn. In the aftermath of this market upheaval, Mow's perspective offers a counterbalance to the prevailing sentiment of uncertainty and panic. As Bitcoin begins to recover, currently trading at $63,950 and showing a 5.22% increase from its recent low, Mow's optimism appears to be grounded in the currency's resilience. However, looming on the horizon is the impending Bitcoin halving, scheduled to occur in just five days.

2024-04-15,"According to U.Today, Josh Olszewicz, a well-known trader, has suggested that Bitcoin could be on the brink of another bearish reversal. This prediction is based on an indicator made up of five different lines, two of which form the cloud, which can be either red or green. The blue line, known as the 'conversion line' or 'Tenkan' line, represents the average for the last nine periods. This line is similar to regular moving averages but offers a higher level of precision. The red line, also known as 'the base line' or the 'Kijun line', represents the midpoint price of the previous 26 periods. If Bitcoin's price falls below the Kijun line, it indicates a bearish bias. Olszewicz noted that Bitcoin experienced its first Kijun tap since the breakout in early June. Despite the possibility of the top cryptocurrency's price recovering from this point, the trader suggests that the preceding 'triple top' structure could indicate a bearish reversal. Bitcoin's price has recently been subject to extreme volatility due to geopolitical tensions. After falling to $61,514, Bitcoin has managed to recover some of its losses and is currently trading at $64,251.

BTC post-2020 halving prices. Source: 10x Research The Bitcoin halving is an event where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, occurring every 210,000 blocks. This event takes place approximately every four years, with the upcoming halving expected around April 20.

It is this imbalance that could lead to a BTC rally, similar to previous patterns witnessed post-halving. Marathon pre-halving accumulation. Source: 10x Research Historically, Bitcoin prices often stabilize in the months following a halving. For instance, BTC prices remained between $9,000 and $11,500 in the five months after the 2020 halving. Thus, according to Thielen, we might not see a significant upward trajectory in the market till around October this year. This could specifically impact altcoins, many of which have seen a substantial drop over the past week, and most of which are still significantly below their 2021 peaks. Thielen points out a key player who may exercise this strategy—Marathon, the world's largest Bitcoin miner. Marathon has allegedly built an inventory that will gradually be sold post-halving to prevent a sudden decline in revenue. Thielen estimates that if all Bitcoin miners adopt a similar strategy, it could result in up to $104 million worth of BTC sold per day, counteracting the supply-demand imbalance that fueled the pre-halving BTC rally.

A report by Trammell Venture Partners (TVP) revealed that the number of Bitcoin-native pre-seed deals increased by 360% last year, while the number of funded Bitcoin companies rose by 56.9%. A Bitcoin native company is defined as a firm whose product's success is closely tied to the Bitcoin network's success. These companies are founded on the belief that Bitcoin is the future global monetary asset. This category includes early-stage startups but excludes late-stage firms, Bitcoin miners, and crypto-oriented companies. Although the total amount of Bitcoin venture dollars invested decreased by 12.5% to $305 million in 2023, the number of Bitcoin venture deals increased by 69.2%. In comparison, the equivalent numbers for the crypto industry were -64.5% and -35.3%, respectively. Crypto venture deals still outnumber Bitcoin ones by about 20:1, but the increase in the latter last year was significant. Some of the major investors last year included General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and Draper Associates, the early-stage VC firm run by Bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper. Despite 2023 being a challenging year for the broader venture capital landscape, the Bitcoin-native sector not only survived the storm but emerged stronger. The increase in funding coincided with a revival of developer activity on Bitcoin over the past year, sparked by new technological capabilities discovered on the network. These include the NFT protocol Ordinals, the Bitcoin computing paradigm BitVM, and the upcoming 'Runes' protocol, which will allow for efficient tokens to be issued on Bitcoin.

2024-04-14,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions have been under scrutiny this year, despite gaining significant traction. Mempool founder Mononaut has been particularly critical, highlighting several technical drawbacks. His views have been supported by Bitcoin Ordinals founder Casey Rodarmor. Bitcoin Layer 2 networks are secondary protocols built on the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to improve scalability and transaction efficiency. They achieve this by offloading transactions from the main blockchain, which results in faster transaction processing, decreased congestion, and lower fees across the Bitcoin network. Layer 2s also allow developers to integrate smart contract functionalities on the blockchain, thereby extending the protocol's capabilities. However, Mononaut has identified several issues with these implementations. He argued that if a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution lacks support for unilateral exit, it functions more as a multi-signature system than a true Layer 2 solution. He also criticized Layer 2 solutions that involve venture capital investors and introduce their own tokens, likening them to pump and dump schemes. He further warned against Layer 2s backed by upgradeable Ethereum contracts and controlled by a single entity, viewing them as potential rug pulls. Mononaut also cautioned against solutions that incentivize locking up coins for extended periods, comparing them to previous scams such as Hex 3.0. He criticized solutions that claim to be Bitcoin-native but are actually Ethereum multi-signature systems, labeling them as affinity scams. He also highlighted the danger of systems that lack comprehensive technical documentation, comparing them to the infamous Bitconnect scam. Despite the criticism, prominent Bitcoin educator Dan Held, a vocal proponent of Layer 2s on Bitcoin, expects an explosion of such solutions as the bull run unfolds. In an interview with CryptoQuant, Held acknowledged the inefficiencies of existing Layer 2s, such as Lightning Network, Liquid, and Rootstock, but still believes that the latest resurgence could pave the way for many new players.

Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin's price dipped to $60,919 before finding support at $62,060 on April 13. Its current price stands at $63,858, according to CoinMarketCap data. Such a rapid price drop inevitably led to sizeable liquidations from leveraged positions on Bitcoin. Using CoinGlass data, those liquidations amount to $319.15 million in the past 24 hours, including $256.58 million from long positions and $62.58 million from short ones. A total of $319.15 million was liquidated in Bitcoin positions over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinGlass Despite traders preparing for additional declines, a reversion in Bitcoin's price to its $67,000 level from just 24 hours ago would risk the liquidation of short positions totaling $1.05 billion.

This projection is based on several factors, including the asset's recent impressive price performance and industry growth expectations. Bitcoin's market cap recently hit an all-time high of over $1.43 trillion and currently stands at around $1.32 trillion. ChatGPT, a popular chatbot, suggested that reaching the $3 trillion milestone is possible, but it depends on various factors, including the impact of the halving event. Historically, halving has been a precursor to a Bitcoin bull run. However, this time the situation seems different as the price of the cryptocurrency started rallying months before the event. Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, believes the rally influenced by the event has already been priced in and does not anticipate significant surges in the near future. Despite this, many remain bullish, predicting record peaks for Bitcoin's valuation post-halving. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-seller 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicted that the asset could reach the $100K mark by September this year. ChatGPT also highlighted that future market dynamics, including institutional adoption, regulatory environments, and macroeconomic elements, will play a role in Bitcoin's market cap. It emphasized that a surge to $3 trillion will only be possible if positive investor sentiment is maintained. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, recently predicted a bright future for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes the global market capitalization of the sector may exceed $5 trillion this year.

Mike Schmidt, co-founder of the Bitcoin non-profit Brink, revealed that he received the FBI subpoena as part of the investigation into Dashjr’s claim. The subpoena specifically requested details about attendees of the October 2022 CoreDev Atlanta event, which occurred just before TABConf 2022.

2024-04-12,"According to Bloomberg, speculators are showing signs of nervousness ahead of a once-every-four-years Bitcoin code adjustment, which has historically been bullish for the cryptocurrency. The implied volatility for Bitcoin options saw a significant increase last weekend, reversing a downward trend observed in the previous week. Bitcoin's price experienced a more than 8% range swing on Friday, causing a stir among investors. Implied volatility on contracts set to expire in the next two weeks has seen the most significant increase, jumping from 59% to 71% in just two days. This suggests that expectations for near-term volatility are on the rise. Traders, uncertain but willing to pay more for options, are likely seeking protection against price swings. This has led to potentially high premiums for downward protection. Since the approval of US exchange-traded funds to hold Bitcoin in January, the cryptocurrency's price has mostly surged. However, in the past month, the price has fluctuated within a range. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming 'halving' event, scheduled for around April 20. This event will see the rewards that miners receive for verifying transactions on the blockchain cut in half, effectively reducing the supply of additional tokens. Bartosz Lipinski, founder and CEO of Cube Exchange, believes the spike in Bitcoin expiries is related to people betting on the demand for Bitcoin on the day of the halving. He suggests that the reduced supply will make Bitcoin more expensive. This event is unique in Bitcoin's history as it creates pressure on an already inelastic price. Previous halvings have shown mixed short-term impacts, while the long-term effects have been bullish. However, Kaiko, a data analytics firm, cautions that a sample size of three is not necessarily large enough to draw definitive conclusions.

2024-04-12,"According to Blockworks, despite the common belief that Bitcoin is scarce due to its supply limit of 21 million BTC, the reality is different. The scarcity notion is challenged by the fact that each Bitcoin is highly divisible, up to eight decimal places, resulting in 100 million satoshis (sats) per Bitcoin. This divisibility makes Bitcoin far from scarce. The current circulating supply of Bitcoin, which is 19.68 million, translates to 1.968 quadrillion sats. By 2140, there will be 2.1 quadrillion sats. To put this into perspective, the base money supply of the US dollar is currently less than $5.9 trillion, and the broader M3 is under $20.8 trillion. If Bitcoin is considered scarce, then so should the US dollar. While it's true that only 21 million people can ever own one Bitcoin each, the number of Bitcoin addresses with at least one Bitcoin is slowly growing. Currently, around 1 million addresses have at least 1 BTC. However, it's not clear how many of these addresses are owned by the same person or how many exchange accounts have million-dollar Bitcoin balances. There are also 53 million Bitcoin addresses that have one satoshi or more. If the current supply were suddenly distributed to these addresses, each would receive more than 37 million sats, equivalent to $25,500. This further challenges the notion of Bitcoin's scarcity. The perception of scarcity is attributed to the 'fiat brain', which automatically considers the largest unit when thinking about Bitcoin as a currency. However, sats are incredibly cheap right now, priced at $0.00069 each, and are often overlooked. If every sat were worth the current price of a whole Bitcoin, an even distribution would give every human alive $16.7 billion BTC. In light of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, there is a renewed interest in the idea of pricing Bitcoin in sats, rather than whole coins. This could potentially shift the perception of Bitcoin's scarcity and provide a more accurate representation of the cryptocurrency's supply.","According to Blockworks, Bitcoin is highly divisible, up to eight decimal places, resulting in 100 million satoshis (sats) per Bitcoin.

2024-04-12,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin, the original digital asset, has plunged to its lowest level in a week. This drop, which saw Bitcoin fall as much as 7.5% to $65,214, was triggered by a resurgence of risk aversion in global financial markets, leading to the liquidation of bullish bets on the cryptocurrency. This is the lowest price Bitcoin has seen since April 5. Smaller tokens such as Solana and Dogecoin experienced even steeper declines, dropping around 12% and 13% respectively. The global financial world was thrown into turmoil on Friday due to a sudden increase in geopolitical risks. This resulted in a slide in stocks and a rush towards safer market corners such as bonds and the dollar. Concurrently, oil prices rallied. Traders who were hoping to profit from the recent rally saw about $417 million in long liquidation of derivatives positions in the past hour, as per data from Coinglass. The liquidation in the past four and 12 hours were $663.9 million and $751 million in long positions, respectively. Total liquidations amounted to $847.6 million.

Gaah warned that this region is risky for traders, and any significant pressure could lead to a correction that would alter the price structure, causing Bitcoin to drop before reaching a new all-time high. Furthermore, the overall market sentiment is currently euphoric, as evidenced by the high funding rates in the Bitcoin futures market. This indicates a period of extreme greed and creates potential for a significant decline. Gaah's analysis comes as Bitcoin recovers from a drop over the past three weeks, where it fell from an all-time high of $73,700 on March 14 to less than $62,000. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency rebounded to the $70,000 range, but has since dropped to $69,300. CryptoQuant also revealed that high demand from large Bitcoin investors is expected to drive the asset's post-halving rally, as the effects of the quadrennial event have been diminishing.","Bitcoin may be at risk of a significant price correction, despite the upcoming halving event.

Glassnode pointed out that in previous frenzy phases, Bitcoin's price experienced multiple retractions of more than 10%, with most retractions being even larger, and retractions of 25% or more being quite common. However, in this cycle, since Bitcoin broke its historical high, there have only been two corrections of approximately 10%. Glassnode's analysis provides a fresh perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market. The report's findings suggest that the current bull market may still be in its early stages, despite Bitcoin's recent record-breaking performance. This could indicate that there is still significant potential for further growth in the Bitcoin market. The report also highlights the relative stability of the current Bitcoin market, with fewer large-scale price retractions compared to previous cycles. This could be a sign of increasing maturity and stability in the Bitcoin market, which could potentially attract more investors and further fuel the ongoing bull market.","The current Bitcoin bull market may still be in its early stages, despite Bitcoin's recent record-breaking performance.

2024-04-12,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price, which had slipped below $70,000, has managed to reclaim that level despite increasing outflows from Grayscale's BTC ETF. The cryptocurrency had fallen to $64,500 a little over a week ago following reports of the US government's plans to sell more BTC. However, it began its recovery a day later and had gained around five to six thousand dollars by the end of the business week. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to surpass $70,000 on Sunday, Bitcoin managed to reach a multi-week peak of just over $72,500 on Monday. However, this surge was short-lived, and the asset began to lose traction on Tuesday and Wednesday. The more significant price decline occurred after the US CPI numbers for March were released, causing BTC to slump to $67,500. The bulls returned, propelling another leg up that resulted in Bitcoin jumping to $71,000. It has remained close to that level, but its market capitalization has slipped to just shy of $1.4 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins, however, has increased to 50.6%. Interestingly, Bitcoin's price has remained above $70,000 even though the outflows from Grayscale's GBTC fund have accelerated once again after recent stagnation. The rising BTC dominance means that most altcoins have suffered, with ETH slipping by about 2% to $3,520.

In February, Ark Invest published a research report detailing the potential impact of institutional investments and allocations from the global $250 trillion investable asset base on Bitcoin's price. The report suggested that a 1% allocation from this asset base could drive BTC's price to $120,000. Similarly, a 4.8% average maximum Sharpe ratio allocation from 2015 to 2023 could position BTC at $550,000, while a 19.4% allocation could propel the cryptocurrency to $2.3 million.

The 10-year real interest rate. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis Despite the potential short-term negative impact of high inflation on crypto, Pandl also identifies several factors such as booming nominal growth, Bitcoin halving, and increasing crypto adoption as catalysts that would foster a supportive environment for the crypto markets. Recent data shows that the inflation in March expanded by 0.4% month-on-month and 3.5% year-over-year, outperforming the estimates of 0.3% and 3.4% respectively from a Dow Jones economists survey. Persistent high inflation rates would limit the Fed's ability to cut interest rates, resonating with Pandl's viewpoint. Despite the potential short-term hike in the real interest rate posing as a negative, Pandl firmly believes that demand for store-of-value assets will remain consistent in the longer term. Spikes in the 10-year real interest rate in correlation with significant Bitcoin price drops have been observed at times when the rate experienced significant monthly rises. After the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, Bitcoin did undergo a slight price downswing.

2024-04-11,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, founder of business intelligence firm MicroStrategy and the company's Bitcoin strategy leader, has issued a reminder to the cryptocurrency community about an upcoming significant Bitcoin event. Saylor, who is known for his frequent Bitcoin-related posts, recently tweeted about the impending Bitcoin halving, which is expected to take place in nine days. The Bitcoin halving is a fundamental event for Bitcoin enthusiasts and the wider crypto community. This will be the fourth halving since Bitcoin's inception in 2009. After the halving, miners' rewards per block will be reduced by half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Consequently, the total amount of Bitcoin issued per day will decrease from 900 to 450 BTC. Many cryptocurrency analysts believe that the halving will provide enough momentum for Bitcoin's price to reach a new all-time high. The last halving event in 2020 led to two historic peaks in Bitcoin's price in 2021. The first peak was largely attributed to Elon Musk and Tesla, as the company purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and added it to its balance sheet. Tesla also accepted Bitcoin as a payment option for its electric cars for several months. This year, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high on March 14, hitting the $73,750 mark. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $67,621, reflecting a 4% drop in the last hour.","The Bitcoin halving is taking place in nine days.

2024-04-11,"According to Blockworks, the Bitcoin halving event, a significant occurrence in the Bitcoin world, is expected to take place next week. Bitcoin is purposely designed to have a maximum supply of 21 million coins to prevent inflation and maintain the currency's scarcity. The halving will not significantly affect everyday Bitcoin holders, but it will reduce the rewards for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC) to 3.125 BTC. This reduction will inevitably lead to a revenue cut for miners, and less efficient miners may be excluded from accessing Bitcoin rewards. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's creator, initially hoped that Bitcoin would become widely adopted over time, allowing transaction fees to cover miners' operational costs. While miners are starting to earn more revenue through transaction fees, there are concerns that these fees alone are not enough to keep miners on the network. As a result, many Bitcoin developers are working on tools to attract more users to the blockchain ecosystem. Mark Hendrickson, the general manager of Bitcoin wallet Leather, informed Blockworks of a resurgence in Bitcoin development over the past year. Developers are now focusing on enhancing Bitcoin's programmability, and there are encouraging signs of healthy competition in the ecosystem to unlock Bitcoin functionality. Jeremy Bruestle, the CEO and co-founder of RISC Zero, echoed this sentiment. He noted a growing interest in integrating zero-knowledge (ZK) technology into the Bitcoin blockchain, with significant resources being allocated to innovation in the ecosystem. Bruestle believes that the adoption of ZK technology on Bitcoin could enable what smart contracts are on Ethereum to the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, Hendrickson remains cautiously optimistic about the future. He believes that with the current pace of innovation development, there should be a focus on token standards over experiments in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 'We must provide security, safety and an easy user experience if we're going to truly bring activities like DeFi, art collecting and more to Bitcoin,' he said.","The Bitcoin halving event is taking place next week.

2024-04-10,"According to U.Today, the ongoing debate about the rivalry between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold has taken a new turn. Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently shared his insights, stating that Bitcoin has outperformed gold over the past year. For centuries, gold has been a dominant hedge against inflation and a store of value. However, its efficiency as a store of value is being questioned with the emergence of Bitcoin. While gold has shown a mild growth rate, Bitcoin has demonstrated a rapid and massive growth rate that surpasses gold on any simultaneous time frame. The BTC Gold Ratio chart, which represents the amount of gold required to buy one Bitcoin, has been steadily increasing over the past year. At the time of Brandt's post, the ratio was 29.91, up from around 20 at the start of the year. This indicates that more gold is now needed to buy the equivalent of one BTC. Despite the relevance of gold, Bitcoin brings new technical and monetary advantages that make it a more economically viable option. Unlike gold, which has an unlimited supply, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in January will trigger a defined emission of BTC on a daily basis. These pseudo-deflationary features, along with the massive capital inflow from spot Bitcoin ETF products, are driving the price of the asset to new highs.

2024-04-10,"According to U.Today, the countdown to Bitcoin's (BTC) much-anticipated halving event has started, with renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo making a significant prediction. Woo suggests that the halving could have a substantial impact on Bitcoin's price, potentially causing it to surge dramatically. Bitcoin halving, a preprogrammed event that happens roughly every four years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined, results in the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain being halved. This decrease in mining rewards is intended to control inflation and ensure that the total supply of BTC remains capped at 21 million coins. Woo's analysis indicates that the forthcoming halving will result in a significant decrease in Bitcoin's annual supply growth. At present, the annual supply growth rate is 1.7%. However, post-halving, this rate will be reduced to just 0.85%. To provide context, Woo noted that the annual supply growth rate of gold is 1.6%, implying that BTC will soon have a lower supply growth rate than gold. He also compared Bitcoin's supply growth rate to that of the U.S. dollar (USD), which is currently experiencing a negative growth rate of -1.7% due to inflation. He stated that the typical range for annual supply growth in fiat currencies is between 5% and 10%. When the USD supply growth reverts to this normal range, Woo predicts that Bitcoin's price will surge dramatically. The halving event is generally seen as a positive indicator for BTC, as it slows the rate at which new coins are introduced into circulation.

Contrary to the claims of some critics, Saylor stated that 'laser eyes' is not a gimmick, but a symbol of true Bitcoiners. The 'laser eyes' trend began in 2021 when Bitcoin enthusiasts, expecting the cryptocurrency to surge to $100,000 following the halving event a year prior, added 'laser eyes' to their Twitter profile pictures. Saylor was among those who participated in this trend, along with other notable figures such as VC investor Anthony Pompliano. In a recent tweet, Saylor compared Bitcoin to a bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software, offering a global, affordable, simple, and secure savings account for billions of people. He also shared advice on how to 'become the money', suggesting that one needs to remember 12 digits, a reference to the private keys of a cold storage cryptocurrency wallet for holding Bitcoin. In related news, Dan Tapiero, a major global investor and co-founder of Gold Bullion International and 10T Holdings, made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin. Tapiero suggested that concerns about monetary debasement, driven by a 60% increase in the Treasury market over the past five years, could push Bitcoin's price above the $200,000 mark in the near future.

2024-04-09,"According to Cointelegraph: Contrary to past trends, the forthcoming Bitcoin halving may not necessarily result in reduced profitability for miners, says Laurent Benayoun, CEO of Acheron Trading. Despite the 50% reduction in Bitcoin supply issuance after the halving event, Benayoun suggests that increasing network fees might compensate for decreased mining rewards. Bitcoin average transaction fees chart. Source: YCharts The Bitcoin halving is scheduled to occur on April 19, cutting block issuance rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In previous halving scenarios, smaller mining operations often exited the industry due to diminished block rewards. However, the CEO postulates that the situation would differ post-2024 halving because of the rising network fees, spurred by Ordinals inscriptions and Bitcoin-native decentralized finance, or BTCFi. Current average Bitcoin network fees, which incentivize miners to include a transaction in the next block, stand at $4.88 per transaction, down from $16.13 a month ago. However, these fees have surged over 86% in the past year. BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Joe Downie, chief marketing officer of NiceHash, affirms that Bitcoin miners would typically remain profitable if the BTC price stays above the $70,000 mark since they're profitable at a BTC price over $35,000 at the current block rewards. Factors like the quality and energy efficiency of a mining firm's equipment will also influence its profitability beyond Bitcoin's price, explains Downie. Therefore, despite the halving event, miners with newer, more energy-efficient models will likely still turn a profit. The impact of Bitcoin’s price appreciation, coupled with the increase in network fees, could mean fewer mining companies being forced out of business in the aftermath of this halving, compared to previous cycles, according to Benayoun.","The forthcoming Bitcoin halving event may not result in reduced profitability for miners, according to Laurent Benayoun, CEO of Acheron Trading.

2024-04-09,"According to CryptoPotato, the cryptocurrency community is preparing for the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving, expected around April 20. However, there are differing opinions on the immediate and long-term impact of this event. Arthur Hayes recently shared his views, suggesting that while the halving might boost prices in the medium term, the asset could experience a slump both before and after the event. He stressed that while the halving is often seen as a bullish catalyst, the consensus around its positive impact could result in unexpected market movements. Hayes stated, 'When most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually occurs.' Hayes noted that the halving coincides with a period of tighter than usual dollar liquidity, which could increase market volatility. His analysis suggests that reducing block rewards for miners and tighter dollar liquidity could lead to a 'firesale' of crypto assets, pushing prices down. In light of these potential market movements, Hayes has decided to refrain from trading until May, emphasizing the need for caution in these uncertain times. He revealed that he has already taken full profits on several positions, reallocating the proceeds into stablecoin-based investments to earn yields. Hayes also discussed the impact of Federal Reserve and Treasury policies on financial markets. He explained how troubled banks can access liquidity through facilities like the discount window, and the implications of this on market stability. He noted a discrepancy between the previous bailout program and the discount window. While the bailout program restored solvency by reimbursing losses, the discount window only provides cash equivalent to the market value of securities. Hayes suggested that the Fed could equalize treatment between the two mechanisms, effectively continuing a 'stealth banking bailout' by supporting bankrupt banks with printed money. This could increase the balance sheets of bankrupt banks, preventing market-induced bankruptcies post-bailout program expiration.","The Bitcoin halving is expected around April 20th.

2024-04-09,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has bounced back from the $65K mark a few days ago and is on track to set a new all-time high soon. The daily chart reveals a large symmetrical triangle pattern, with the market currently testing the upper boundary of this pattern. If the price successfully breaches the upper boundary, a rally toward the $75K level and the creation of a new all-time high could become increasingly likely. The Relative Strength Index also displays values above 50%, suggesting that the momentum is bullish and a price surge is probable. In the 4-hour timeframe, the price has recently surpassed the triangle pattern and is currently retesting the broken trendline.

Conversely, a fall back inside the triangle could render the recent breakout a false one, making a decline toward the lower boundary of the pattern or even the $60K support zone more likely.

2024-04-08,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin miners are bracing for a significant reduction in per-block rewards, which are set to halve from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC later this month. This fourth halving event in the network's history could pose a significant challenge for even the most well-equipped mining firms, and potentially make the already slim profit margins of home-based miners even slimmer. The situation is straightforward for miners: if the halving increases Bitcoin's price, their investment is justified. However, if it doesn't, smaller miners could be left with idle ASICs, high energy bills, and little chance of recouping their costs. Some home-based miners have shared their concerns on the r/BitcoinMining subreddit, stating that Bitcoin would need to reach between $70,000 and $140,000 for them to break even or maintain their current profit margins post-halving. There are other factors that home-based miners need to consider beyond the price of Bitcoin. One such factor is Bitcoin's hash rate, which has been growing at an increasing rate throughout the network's history. The hash rate is essentially a measure of the competition to mine Bitcoin blocks. High electricity prices can also pose a challenge, especially as power grids in the US and elsewhere struggle to meet the demand for compute-intensive AI. Individual miners have very low odds of successfully mining Bitcoin on their own. Many choose to join mining pools, which coordinate and share rewards among several miners, while also charging varying fees. The prices of miners vary, and more-efficient ASICs are released over time. Some miners have given up hope altogether, with several forum posters suggesting that prospective miners gradually purchase Bitcoin over time, a process known as dollar cost averaging. Two miners told Blockworks that using mining rigs for home heating was one way to make home-based mining profitable. ASIC miners emit heat as they run, and some Bitcoin enthusiasts have developed ways of capturing this heat and circulating it through their homes. However, those already involved in mining are unlikely to be deterred by the halving, with many having planned for this event for some time.","Bitcoin's per-block rewards are set to halve from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC later this month.

2024-04-08,"According to U.Today, the United States is set to announce the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March on April 10. The CPI, a measure of inflation, can significantly influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The following day, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in March will be released, with a high likelihood of interest rates remaining unchanged in May. Such decisions can directly or indirectly affect the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. When interest rates remain steady, it often indicates that the economy is stable enough not to require higher rates to curb inflation. For Bitcoin and other digital assets, stable interest rates could be seen as positive. Lower borrowing costs could lead to increased investment in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's current price is around $71,539. If the news on April 10 and 11 suggests a favorable U.S. economy, Bitcoin could potentially see a boost as more investors may seek additional risk exposure. On the technical side, the key level to watch is around $67,000. If Bitcoin can maintain above this level, it might climb towards its all-time high. However, if Bitcoin cannot maintain this level, there is support at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $57,757. If the Bitcoin price remains bullish and the news from the CPI and FOMC is positive or at least not negative, digital assets might see stabilization.

This trend suggests that more investors are choosing to store their Bitcoin in private wallets rather than on exchanges, possibly leading to a supply crunch where demand surpasses available supply.

Bitcoin core maintainer Ava Chow ultimately rejected Dashjr's request and did not adopt his code, stating, 'It's clear that this pull request is controversial and in its current state, there's no hope of reaching a conclusion that everyone can accept.' Dashjr, who receives no payment for maintaining the BIP process, assigning numbers, or organizing the BIP GitHub, responded to recent criticism by stating that another BIP editor had stopped working in January. He emphasized that he works voluntarily for BIP without any remuneration. Given his hardline stance on Ordinals, Dashjr appears to be struggling to justify his role as the sole administrator of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. His refusal to assign BIP numbers to certain proposals has led many Bitcoin users to question why the review process for Bitcoin network upgrades is not more decentralized.","Luke Dashjr is being criticized for refusing to assign a BIP number to a proposal by another Bitcoin core contributor, Casey Rodarmor.

2024-04-06,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin miners are gearing up for the fourth Bitcoin halving, expected in about 15 days. This event will significantly reduce their block rewards, posing challenges to their profitability. Despite an increase in selling activity by some Bitcoin mining companies, they continue to grapple with issues such as lower transaction fees, heightened mining competition, and the requirement for more computing power to generate the same amount of Bitcoin (BTC). The halving will cut Bitcoin block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, slashing miners' revenues by 50%. To maintain profitability, miners will need higher BTC prices. CryptoQuant's recent weekly crypto report showed that the mining industry's daily revenue hit record levels in 2024 due to rising BTC prices. While the current daily revenue is around $67 million, it peaked at $79 million in early March, a 3.5x increase from figures recorded in May 2020, just before the previous halving event. However, the increase in daily revenue did not reflect in the hashprice, which is 30% lower than before the last halving. The hashprice, or the average revenue a miner earns each time it attempts to find a valid block, is currently $0.11 and is expected to drop to $0.055 after the halving. In May 2020, the hashprice was around $0.16 TH/s. Additionally, the Bitcoin hashrate has increased more than five times since the previous halving, from 116 EH/s to 600 EH/s, indicating that miners need more computing power to produce the same amount of BTC per day. Bitcoin transaction fees have also dropped 90% from a daily total of 412 BTC in mid-December 2023 to 29 BTC currently. Transaction fees now account for about 3% of the total block reward, down from 37% in mid-December 2023. To compensate for the loss of block reward, higher fees or Bitcoin prices are necessary, according to CryptoQuant analysts. These challenges have already impacted the daily BTC production of major Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, Bitfarms, and Marathon Digital. The effects of the upcoming months on these firms remain to be seen.","Bitcoin miners are preparing for the fourth Bitcoin halving, expected in about 15 days.

2024-04-06,"According to U.Today, renowned investor Anthony Scaramucci has predicted a significant rise in Bitcoin's value ahead of the anticipated halving event in April. Scaramucci believes that the halving, a process where miner rewards are halved, is not yet factored into the current Bitcoin price. He suggests that Bitcoin's valuation could increase by as much as ten times from its current level, potentially reaching half the valuation of gold. However, he clarified that this surge would not occur in the short term. In April 2024, the Bitcoin market is witnessing substantial growth, with the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving over $10 billion in new flows for Bitcoin. This achievement surpasses the $10 billion milestone reached by the Gold ETF in just a quarter of the time. Despite Bitcoin's potential, Scaramucci acknowledges its volatility and cyclical nature. He predicts a potential price target of $170,000 for this cycle, driven by waves of demand and adoption. Scaramucci, a vocal Bitcoin advocate, has been actively promoting its transformative potential. He remains optimistic about Bitcoin ETFs, drawing comparisons between Bitcoin and Gold as stores of value. He also speculates on the eventual recognition of Bitcoin's value by traditional investors like Warren Buffett. In addition to Bitcoin, Scaramucci has expressed interest in other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche, although Bitcoin remains his primary focus due to its market dominance. In a recent post on the X platform, Scaramucci reacted to the latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office indicating that the U.S. federal debt will rise to 116% by 2034.

Mow also expressed his belief that Bitcoin is on its way to hitting the $1 million price mark. He has mentioned this prediction multiple times recently, particularly in the lead-up to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for the second half of April.

ETFs, which provide a new avenue for regular investors to invest in Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, are believed to have a significant future impact on the influx of capital into Bitcoin. However, this effect is expected to unfold over several years. The slow pace of traditional finance is cited as a reason for this gradual impact.

2024-04-05,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in the first phase of its halving cycle, aligning with analysts' predictions. Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital has stated that the recent 18% retrace in Bitcoin's value was anticipated, as similar declines were observed prior to the second and third halvings. This suggests that Bitcoin may follow patterns seen in previous halving events, including a post-halving surge that could drive the asset to new peaks. The three stages of the Bitcoin halving include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation, and the parabolic uptrend. The initial stage typically takes place 28 to 14 days before the event and can last for several weeks. The second phase begins after the retrace has bottomed out and can continue for up to five months, while the third phase can extend for over a year. During the 2016 halving, the retrace was 38% and lasted four days. In 2020, it was 20% and lasted eight weeks. Currently, with Bitcoin approximately 13 days away from the halving, the asset has seen a roughly 18% decline over the past three weeks. Rekt Capital noted that this cycle has shown characteristics from both the 2016 and 2020 halvings, suggesting that it may replicate parts of their pre-halving price behaviors. On-chain metrics indicate that Bitcoin may be entering the re-accumulation phase. With the asset's resistance level at $70,000, Rekt Capital suggests that the market may have set the high re-accumulation range. As re-accumulation follows the bottoming out of the retrace, it is also possible that the pre-halving bottom has been reached. According to Rekt Capital, the goal now is for Bitcoin to move sideways until the halving and beyond.

The upcoming halving in April will see mining rewards reduced from 6.25 to 3.125 coins per block. Despite this, DHI and Bitdeer are confident they can maintain operational efficiency even if the price of Bitcoin declines post-halving. Bitdeer boasts one of the industry's lowest costs per Bitcoin mined, at $20,000 per coin. The crypto sector faced a significant challenge in 2022 when soaring energy costs and Bitcoin's price falling below $16,000 led to some miners going bankrupt. The rising costs of Bitcoin computing are due to an increase in Bitcoin's mining difficulty, a measure of the computing power required to add a new block to the network. This difficulty has reached record highs ahead of the halving, offsetting some of the gains from the price rally. Bhutan, located between China and India, has been seeking ways to diversify its hydropower-dependent economy. DHI, which manages the government's diverse investments, views blockchain technology as a crucial component in building an 'innovation ecosystem for a startup economy.' The investment arm has been exploring asset tokenization and is also developing 'Bhutanverse,' a metaverse project.","Bhutan's investment arm, DHI, and Bitdeer, a Singapore-based company, have announced plans to increase the Himalayan kingdom's Bitcoin mining capacity by 500 megawatts by the first half of 2025.

2024-04-04,"According to U.Today, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a well-known Bitcoin advocate, recently drew a comparison between Bitcoin and Neo from the iconic film 'The Matrix' on social media. Mow likened Bitcoin's penetration into the traditional financial system to the scene in the movie where Neo dives into Agent Smith, causing an explosion. He suggested that Bitcoin, like Neo, has infiltrated the legacy financial system through spot ETFs and is now operating within it. Mow did not predict a specific outcome but expressed his anticipation for the unfolding events, particularly whether Bitcoin ETFs will succeed in transforming the traditional financial system. His recent posts suggest that he expects Bitcoin to permanently alter the legacy system. Mow strongly believes that Bitcoin will reach the $1 million mark in the near future, with the recently launched spot ETFs bringing this moment closer. Another key catalyst Mow often mentions is the upcoming Bitcoin halvening, scheduled for the latter part of April. This event will reduce miners' rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC for each new block generated. Mow and other Bitcoin enthusiasts believe that the halvening will create a supply shock, while ETFs have already caused a demand shock. They anticipate a surge in the BTC price when these two shocks collide. In related news, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) outperformed other ETFs on April 3, with a massive inflow of $116.7 million, according to a tweet from the @spotonchain analytics account.

2024-04-04,"Bitcoin halvings, which are automated reductions in the issuance of new BTC tokens, have historically created ripples across the cryptocurrency industry. These events impact the supply dynamics of Bitcoin, trigger changes in market sentiment, and drive its adoption rates to new heights. These critical events, which increase Bitcoin's visibility, have always led to a rise in Bitcoin prices as well as adoption rates. As the number of BTC tokens available for mining gets halved, discussions around the blockchain technology used, the dynamics of the Bitcoin network, and the place of cryptocurrencies as unique asset classes within the financial markets often get amplified. Despite the historical patterns showing that Bitcoin prices and adoption usually increase in the months after a halving event, it's important to note that the upcoming April 2024 halving is already exhibiting unique characteristics. The 2024 halving deviates from previous halvings, hinting already at unprecedented market movements. A Bitcoin halving fundamentally shifts the crypto ecosystem, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. Each halving cycles Bitcoins visibility, adoption, and innovation through newfound peaks, reinforcing its tag as the locomotive of the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem. Often, Bitcoin's heightened visibility around halving events lures new participants into the market. Furthermore, the events pressure cryptocurrency initiatives to reassess the underlying technology and network dynamics as miners prepare for the aftermath, which usually sees mining profitability margins dwindle. This tends to drive network enhancements and innovation while increasing the network's appeal to a broader audience. Historical data shows that the number of active BTC addresses often grows by roughly 90% within the first 150 days of halving events. This sheds light on Bitcoin's adoption post-halving events. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also surges around these events, spurred by the narrative of Bitcoin's potential as an anti-inflationary store of value and investable asset. However, despite these broad narratives and developments, Bitcoin halvings each represent a unique shift in the evolution of the flagship cryptocurrency. These shifts are heavily influenced by market conditions, regulatory developments, and advancements in technology, requiring caution and vigilance from participants navigating the landscape of digital assets. The upcoming 2024 halving in April is no exception and will take place amidst its unique circumstances, including unprecedented inflows back into the crypto industry and burgeoning institutional engagement advanced by recent US approvals of spot BTC ETFs.

Back shared his views on digital assets with the crypto community via the X app. He argued that Bitcoin's benefits are numerous and it could be cold stored instead of being used in DeFi. He believes that Bitcoin is a viable long-term asset and a store of value. Back's views align with those of Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned finance management expert, who believes that due to the current inflationary trend, it is crucial to store value in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Back expressed his skepticism about participating in DeFi, stating that some people are determined to speculate on DeFi platforms without learning from past mistakes. He suggested that buying Bitcoin and cold storing it is a safer and more profitable strategy. In response to questions about his Bitcoin strategy, Back revealed that he maintains a long-term hold strategy as he is convinced of Bitcoin's value proposition. Even during market cycles when Bitcoin peaks, while other investors sell to buy back at lower prices, Back prefers to hold. He stated, 'I have a really hard time selling Bitcoin. So, I'm typically perpetually all out of fiat.' While Back is not against diversifying assets, he advises caution, particularly when it comes to complex and risky DeFi platforms. He recommends platforms like Hodl Hodl, Debificom, or Unchainedcom, which he believes are simple, robust, and secure.

2024-04-04,"According to U.Today, Bitcoin (BTC) is on a potentially profitable path, with a respected crypto analyst, Jelle, forecasting a strong target of $82,000 for the BTC price. This prediction is based on the observation of a bullish pennant formation, a technical pattern that could indicate an upcoming price increase. Despite any short-term volatility or consolidation, the bullish pennant formation implies that the overall momentum remains positive, potentially leading to a breakout and continuation of the upward trend. Jelle's identification of this pattern suggests that he believes Bitcoin is set for further upward movement, supporting his $82,000 target. This analysis comes at a critical time, with the Bitcoin halving event just 15 days away. The halving event, which happens approximately every four years, halves the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks, resulting in a reduced supply of new coins entering circulation. This built-in scarcity mechanism has historically triggered bullish price movements, as the decreased supply often drives increased demand and speculative buying. It's important to note that the Bitcoin halving event doesn't just reduce the supply of new coins; it also serves as a symbolic reminder of Bitcoin's deflationary nature and the finite nature of its total supply. This narrative often resonates with investors and contributes to the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin during these periods. Despite Bitcoin's current trading price of $66,354, Jelle's ambitious target of $82,000 doesn't seem as unrealistic as it might initially seem. BTC recently reached an all-time high of $73,805.27 on March 14, demonstrating its potential for significant price appreciation. Considering the historical impact of the halving event on Bitcoin's price, surpassing the previous all-time high and reaching Jelle's target becomes a plausible scenario. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin's price trajectory is further reinforced by historical data. Previous halving events in 2016 and 2020 were followed by extended bull runs that saw the BTC price multiply several times over. This consistent pattern of post-halving price appreciation has instilled confidence in the community, fueling expectations of another substantial price rally in the near future.","Bitcoin is on a potentially profitable path.

2024-04-03,"According to U.Today, Peter Brandt, a well-known trader, recently made a bold statement about Bitcoin, claiming its long-term superiority over gold. Brandt, who has extensive experience in trading, portrayed Bitcoin as the undisputed king, reducing gold to the status of a mere baron and referring to silver as the court jester. He supported his claim with a compelling chart that showed the steady decrease in gold's value compared to Bitcoin since the latter's introduction on exchanges in the early 2010s. Over a 12-year period, the value of gold fell from 740 BTC to just 0.0352 BTC, reinforcing Brandt's optimistic view of Bitcoin's dominance. Despite Brandt's firm prediction, the immediate landscape offers a more nuanced view. ETF expert Eric Balchunas recently pointed out a potential shift in market sentiment, noting a resurgence in the appeal of gold compared to BTC. Balchunas suggested that the growing interest in gold, along with Bitcoin's recent struggles, could indicate a temporary shift of funds away from the cryptocurrency. He hinted at a possible end to the unprecedented 54-day streak of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, speculating that investors might shift their focus to gold and related instruments. While Brandt's long-term vision emphasizes Bitcoin's lasting dominance, Balchunas' observations suggest short-term fluctuations that could affect market dynamics.

2024-04-03,"According to CoinDesk, Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has attributed the surge in Bitcoin's value this year to currency devaluations in countries like Nigeria, Egypt, and Argentina. She has described Bitcoin as an 'insurance policy' against unstable regimes and poor fiscal and monetary policies. Bitcoin has seen a growth of over 130% in the past year, reaching a record high of $73,800 last month. This rise coincided with a surge in demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. In an interview with CNBC, Wood highlighted a different narrative, stating that global currency devaluations, which are not being widely discussed, are contributing to Bitcoin's rise. She pointed out that the Nigerian Naira has depreciated by 50-60% in the past nine months, Egypt's currency has been devalued by 40%, and Argentina continues to devalue its currency. Wood believes that these devaluations are leading people to seek safety in Bitcoin as a hedge against the loss of purchasing power and wealth. Two weeks ago, Wood reiterated her prediction of a $1.5 million price target for Bitcoin, referring to it as a 'financial super highway.' She noted that even in the United States, when regional banks collapsed last year, Bitcoin's value increased by 40%. She emphasized that Bitcoin does not carry counterparty risk, making it both a risk-on and risk-off asset. She recalled that ARK Invest first invested in Bitcoin when it was valued at $250, at a time when Greece was considering exiting the Eurozone.","Bitcoin has seen a rise of over 130% in the past year, reaching a record high of $73,800 last month.

2024-04-03,"According to U.Today, Michael Saylor, the cofounder and chairman of MicroStrategy, recently made a statement about Bitcoin's (BTC) scarcity on his official Twitter account. He claimed that the total issuance of Bitcoin will never exceed 276^3. However, this estimation, while mathematically correct, is technically incorrect in terms of Bitcoin's total supply. The figure of 276^3 equates to 21,024,576. However, according to the original design of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, only 21 million BTC units can ever be issued. Currently, the circulating supply of Bitcoin is 19,671,900 BTC, leaving only about 1,328,100 BTC units left for mining. Saylor's statement can be seen as a call to action to purchase Bitcoin, a sentiment echoed by other major proponents such as Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad'. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event will reduce the rate of emission of the digital currency by half, making any potential accumulation move more expensive. The remaining 1.3 million Bitcoin units will not be released until 2140, and there will be no increase in this number. Saylor's firm, MicroStrategy, has been a consistent buyer of Bitcoin since 2020, accumulating more than 214,000 Bitcoin units. The business intelligence and software firm has even issued Convertible Senior Notes with different maturity dates to invest in the digital currency. MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a Bitcoin evangelist, a role that complements those of market leaders like Samson Mow.

This statement was made in response to a prediction by American financial writer Harry Dent. Kiyosaki, the author of several financial books including 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', stated that he hopes Dent's prediction comes true as it would create new multi-millionaires and possibly a few billionaires. Harry Dent, known for his financial and economic recession predictions, has had a mixed record with his forecasts. Despite many unsuccessful predictions, he accurately foresaw the 2000 dotcom crash and Japan's 1989 bubble burst and recession. In October 2023, Dent told Think Advisor that the United States economy would experience 'the crash of a lifetime' in 2024, with the stock market falling 86% on the S&P index. He also predicted that this crash would affect every sector, including real estate, and that the central bank's attempts to mitigate this disaster would only exacerbate the next one. Kiyosaki believes that if Dent's 'everything crash' prediction comes true, the Baby Boomer generation could be the biggest losers as their homes would lose value. However, Kiyosaki plans to acquire more real estate, gold, silver, and Bitcoin to increase his wealth. He stated, 'If Harry is correct I will simply buy more real estate, gold, and silver. If Bitcoin drops to $200 per coin I will buy as many coins as I can. If Harry is right; those who are prepared will soon be multi-millionaires and possibly a few new billionaires. I hope Harry Dent is right. Even if he isn’t, those who are holding gold, silver, and Bitcoin will be richer.' Kiyosaki continues to prefer Bitcoin over other assets, including gold and silver.

2024-04-03,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin's notorious price fluctuations are proving to be profitable for quantitative hedge-fund investors and academic researchers. A growing body of research, including studies from the world's largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager, Man Group Plc, and the University of Cambridge, suggests that the quant strategy of trend following is particularly effective for Bitcoin's price volatility. Quant funds such as the $2 billion Florin Court Capital LLC have been using these strategies since 2017, and their cross-asset performance has been enhanced by crypto exposure. Researchers at Man Group's Man AHL unit found that a proxy long-short trend strategy in both Bitcoin and Ether has outperformed buy-and-hold investments in the coins since 2017 when scaled for 10% volatility. This strategy captures gains during a rally and takes short positions when the trend is negative. However, there are challenges to this approach. The relatively small crypto data sets are cited as a barrier to broader implementation of systematic trading. Furthermore, the models Man Group uses rely on data starting in 2016-2017, when institutional investors became more active in the space. The trend-following strategy is not only being examined by sophisticated hedge funds but is also going mainstream. Investors can now access a similar strategy through an exchange-traded product. This product dynamically allocates between Bitcoin futures and Treasury bills with a maturity of one to three months. The ETF increases exposure to Bitcoin futures when prices rise and reduces its allocation when prices fall, without ever going short. Despite the promising results of trend following for Bitcoin and Ether, quants remain cautious about applying these systematic techniques elsewhere in the crypto space. Stablecoins, which are intended to track an asset like the US dollar one-for-one, are obvious examples. So are the highly speculative, often-novelty tokens known as memecoins, which can be much more volatile than Bitcoin and Ether.",Bitcoin's price fluctuations are profitable for quantitative hedge-fund investors and academic researchers.

Markus, known on Twitter as 'Shibetoshi Nakamoto,' posted a meme from the Star Wars II movie, suggesting that Bitcoin warned about its intention to crash on April Fool's day as a 'hilarious joke' but with no intention to recover from it. The world's pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has astounded the cryptocurrency community by plummeting 7.33% and losing several thousand U.S. dollars in value within a few hours, as it fell from $69,700 to $64,700. On April 1, Grayscale ETF faced outflows of more than $302 million. Additionally, the odds of the Federal Reserve cutting down interest rates seem to be getting lower. These factors are likely the drivers that pushed Bitcoin down so far almost instantly. After these factors were spotted, the cryptocurrency market saw a whopping $500 million worth of crypto liquidations, according to data provided by CoinGlass. The single biggest liquidation amounted to the equivalent of nearly $8 million in crypto. Overall, according to Markus's earlier tweets, he does not believe that cryptocurrency price movements can be predicted, particularly for Bitcoin. His view is that crypto is mostly speculative assets, and holding it for a long time is not a mentally healthy pastime.","Billy Markus, the software engineer who created the original meme Dogecoin in collaboration with Jackson Palmer in 2013, has commented on the recent Bitcoin price fall.

Yusko's bullish prediction comes as Bitcoin's price has increased by over 60% since the beginning of the year, breaking its 2021 all-time high of $69,050 and charting a new one of almost $74,000. The latest peak came ahead of the fourth halving for the first time ever, with just a month left until BTC’s production is sliced by half. Yusko highlighted Bitcoin's benefits over other cryptocurrencies and its merits when compared to gold during an interview with CNBC’s Fast Money. He believes that the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which launched in January, are the primary factor behind BTC’s yearly rise. The financial products have seen massive demand from investors, with impressive net inflows for the first two and a half months of trading. Yusko also noted that there's still more room for growth for BTC, especially given the upcoming halving, scheduled to take place in late April. Looking at the broader scale, Yusko predicted that BTC could increase its price against the dollar by 10x over the next decade, potentially reaching around $700,000 per Bitcoin. He is not the only prominent individual who has forecasted a $150,000 price tag for Bitcoin this year. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee also indicated that the asset could more than double its value from its current position in 2024 due to its appeal to Millennials and Gen Z. Additionally, British multinational banking giant Standard Chartered, which used to be among Bitcoin’s most vocal critics, shared a similar prediction for the asset.

2024-04-01,"According to CoinDesk, recent optimism in the Bitcoin ecosystem has been driven by the approval of Bitcoin spot market exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the true potential of Bitcoin lies in its use as a currency rather than an asset held in ETFs or hardware wallets. Zac Townsend, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin-denominated insurance company Meanwhile, believes that the future of Bitcoin involves robust economic activity denominated in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's strengths lie in storing value, settling large payments, and conducting financial services. With at least 57 countries experiencing inflation rates over 10% last year, the day-to-day volatility of Bitcoin's exchange rate may seem less risky than the fiscal and monetary mismanagement of countries worldwide. For this future to exist, companies and institutions must be built within the Bitcoin economy. Meanwhile, one of the first fully-fledged, regulated life insurance companies denominated in Bitcoin, operates on a modified accounting basis with Bitcoin as the unit of currency, regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Operating on the Bitcoin Standard, Meanwhile's balance sheet and income statement are entirely in Bitcoin, with policyholders paying premiums and receiving claims in the cryptocurrency. This approach allows the company to operate without being affected by exchange rate fluctuations. As more businesses and individuals recognize the value of building on the Bitcoin Standard, the focus will shift from Bitcoin's exchange rate to its use as a store-of-value that will appreciate over time.","According to Zac Townsend, the future of Bitcoin lies in its use as a currency rather than an asset held in exchange-traded funds or hardware wallets.

2024-04-01,"According to CoinDesk: The state of Bitcoin varies significantly over the years. From a shy emergence in 2009 to its market-leading dominance, the bitcoin story is perpetually evolving. Going back three years, the start of the last bull cycle saw experts sketching out the future of Bitcoin with scenarios ranging from extreme bullishness to bearishness. It's time to revisit and revamp these scenarios as Bitcoin is about to enter its fourth halving. Amid all the estimates and judgements, the essence remains intact: the future of Bitcoin is unpredictable. However, the unpredictability doesn't quench curiosity or sway enthusiasm. Many even believe that most of the significant use cases 10 years from now would seem mind-boggling today. Taking a leap in the future of Bitcoin, the array of predictions ranges from regulatory hardships to telepathic DeFi. One of them indicates a future where Bitcoin is widely used to pay for goods and services like coffee and beer, while others predict Bitcoin-powered gaming platforms. All these are part of the predictions from industry experts such as Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, Des Dickerson, CEO of THNDR Games, and author Isaiah Jackson. There might be scenarios where traditional finance institutions 'tame' Bitcoin or hefty regulations choke its growth. On the flip side, there's also a possibility of AI-powered Bitcoins, shadow Bitcoin, or Bitcoin thriving as a store of value. Other interesting trails lead to machines sending Bitcoin, rise of Bitcoin ordinals, Bitcoin remaining the same or even a fatal impact due to a Black Swan event. The most exciting prediction talks about the possibility of telepathic Bitcoin. In conclusion, Bitcoin is standing at the crossroads of numerous possibilities, each carrying its exclusive set of challenges and opportunities. What the future holds can only be speculated upon, but one thing is for sure: Bitcoin is here to stay, in one form or another, and it's going to continue shaping the world of finance.","The state of Bitcoin is constantly changing.

2024-04-01,"According to CoinDesk: Bitcoin's recent volatility has surpassed that of Ethereum's as the crypto market braces for Bitcoin's impending halving event. Data from Kaiko reveals that the annualized 30-day historical volatility of Bitcoin rose to nearly 60% last week, exceeding Ethereum's volatility by nearly 10 percentage points, marking the highest spread in at least a year. Traditionally, Bitcoin, with its massive market cap and trading volumes, serves as a relatively steady anchor in comparison to other digital assets, protecting trader portfolios from excessive market swings. However, the recent uptick in volatility levels is noteworthy. Several factors have contributed to this change, notably the greenlighting of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alongside the upcoming Bitcoin blockchain reward halving. The halving event, expected to take place on April 21, will see the per-block reward to miners reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving miners' revenue. While the consensus typically views halving as a bullish event due to the resultant demand-supply imbalance, some experts like Greg Magadini, the director of derivatives at Amberdata, caution that the extent of bullish positioning could trigger a ""sell-the-news"" pullback after the event, thereby causing more volatility. As the market navigates this period, traders and investors are advised to remain vigilant in the face of potentially heightened volatility in the lead-up to and follow-through of the Bitcoin halving.","Bitcoin's volatility has risen to nearly 60% last week.

2024-04-01,"According to CoinDesk, the spread between bitcoin and ether's annualized 30-day historical volatility gauges has increased to the highest in at least a year. The spot ETF inflows and Bitcoin blockchain's impending halving seem to have catalyzed greater volatility in BTC. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value and trading volumes, is supposed to be relatively steady compared to other digital assets, protecting a trader's portfolio from wild swings in the broader market. However, bitcoin has been more volatile than ether recently. Bitcoin's annualized 30-day historical or realized volatility rose to nearly 60% late last week, surpassing ether's 30-day realized volatility by nearly 10 percentage points. That's the highest spread in at least a year, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. Historical volatility indicates the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period. The bitcoin-ether volatility spread flipped positive weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing traders to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. Since then, traders have been squarely focused on the activity in the spot ETFs, with net inflows breeding upside volatility in bitcoin and the broader crypto market. In the meantime, the dwindling probability of the SEC approving an ETH ETF by May seems to have demotivated ether traders. Bitcoin blockchain's upcoming reward halving, a quadrennial event that reduces the pace of per block BTC emission by 50%, could be another reason for relatively higher volatility in the cryptocurrency. On April 21, the inbuilt code will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the miner's revenue, which, as per ByteTree, is currently at $26 billion annually. The consensus is that halving is bullish as it halves the pace of supply expansion, creating a demand-supply imbalance in favor of a price rise, assuming the demand side remains unchanged or strengthens. Bitcoin chalked out stellar rallies, setting new record highs over 12-18 months following the previous halvings, which occurred in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020.",Bitcoin's annualized 30-day historical or realized volatility has risen to nearly 60% late last week.

Analysts expect the present Bitcoin sell-side liquidity inventory to cover demand for six to twelve months. Conversely, a plunge in liquid inventory could pull Bitcoin’s (BTC) price northward. Monthly demand for Bitcoin has risen from 40,000 BTC at the start of 2024 to 213,000 BTC at writing time. CryptoQuant measures the demand by the 30-day growth in the total balance of accumulation addresses – those that only receive and hold BTC.

Whales now hold roughly 1.57 million BTC, a significant increase from 874,000 BTC recorded at the beginning of 2024. While demand soars, sell-side liquidity continues to decline. The amount of BTC at sell-side liquidity entities hovers around 2.7 million BTC, down from an all-time high of 3.5 million BTC recorded in March 2020. With Bitcoin demand skyrocketing and sell-side liquidity falling, the liquid inventory of Bitcoin has plummeted to its lowest ever in terms of monthly demand. Removing the BTC on CEXs outside the U.S. would further reduce the Bitcoin liquid inventory to six months, as U.S. spot ETFs would only source BTC from local entities.","The chances of Bitcoin facing a sell-side liquidity crisis are very high due to Bitcoin demand for the digital asset soaring to unprecedented levels.

Bitcoin has already reached a new all-time high, and there are still three weeks to go until the halving. This has introduced the possibility of this cycle peak coming much earlier than previous ones, which happened in the year following the halving event. If Bitcoin markets pull back after any Federal Reserve rate cuts, it could put it back on track with prior cycles, potentially peaking in 2025. However, if there is no significant correction or consolidation period, it could suggest a left-translated peak. Cowen believes the answer to whether this Bitcoin market cycle is a normal one or left-translated will depend on how the market reacts to rate cuts in a few months.

2024-03-29,"According to PANews, hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital has disclosed a subtle investment thesis: going long on Bitcoin (BTC) while shorting MicroStrategy stock. The premise is that MicroStrategy, positioning itself as a BTC investment tool, has an unreasonable premium compared to the underlying crypto asset that mainly constitutes its value. Kerrisdale Capital's analysis states, ""MicroStrategy's stock price has soared with the recent rise in BTC prices, but as is often the case with crypto assets, things have gotten out of control."" Kerrisdale also highlighted a key difference, pointing out that MicroStrategy's stock price implies a BTC value of ""over $177,000, or 2.5 times the spot price of BTC."" In discussing the reasons behind MicroStrategy's stock price premium, Kerrisdale refuted some views supporting the company's market valuation. The report bluntly states, ""The reasons for giving a premium to MicroStrategy's stock are not enough to justify paying more than double the price for the same coin."" This statement emphasizes Kerrisdale's stance on MicroStrategy's overvaluation in terms of direct BTC exposure. Since 1989, under the leadership of CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been actively accumulating BTC and making it a core pillar of its investment strategy. From August 2020 to 2023, the company conducted significant financial operations to increase its holdings, currently exceeding 214,000 BTC. Kerrisdale's valuation method considers MicroStrategy's enterprise software business and its BTC reserves. The conclusion drawn from the analysis is that although the software business is still in operation, it ""no longer contributes meaningful value to the entire enterprise,"" highlighting the overwhelming impact of BTC on the company's valuation. A key criticism from Kerrisdale is the high premium of MicroStrategy's stock relative to its net asset value (NAV). The report notes, ""MicroStrategy's stock premium is 2.6 times, which is exceptionally high."" Kerrisdale believes that if MicroStrategy's stock premium rate is adjusted to a more historically consistent level, the stock will experience a significant decline relative to BTC's performance. The report delves into the potential impact of MicroStrategy's financial strategy, including its reliance on leverage and the dilutive effect of its financing mechanisms. Kerrisdale's analysis indicates that while MicroStrategy has successfully increased its BTC holdings through aggressive capital market activities, the dilutive effects of debt financing and stock issuance have caused the number of BTC per share to stagnate. Finally, Kerrisdale Capital estimates, ""If the current 2.6 times premium contract is adjusted to a more historically consistent 1.3 times, MSTR's decline relative to BTC will be 50%."" This conclusion is drawn after studying the interactions between MicroStrategy's stock premium, BTC holdings, and broader market dynamics.",Kerrisdale Capital is shorting MicroStrategy stock and going long on Bitcoin (BTC).

The total net inflow for spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $183 million on March 28. SoSo Value data shows that the latest figures contributed to a cumulative net inflow of almost $12.13 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack with more than $95 million net inflows, followed closely by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $69.09 million. Bitwise’s BITB and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded $67 million and $27.6 million in inflows, while VanEck’s HODL settled with inflows of $20 million. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued to witness net outflows, shedding nearly $105 million from its product, the lowest since March 12th. This comes after a minor setback with five consecutive days of outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs from March 18th to 22nd. During this time, Bitcoin briefly plunged below $63,000, sparking concerns among market participants. The rebound to $70,000 improved market sentiment, with the ETF space seeing increased demand and an influx of new players.

2024-03-29,"According to PANews, the Bitcoin NFT project INK experienced a significant increase in price and daily trading volume after its official launch on March 29th. INK, a PFP NFT project built on Bitcoin at the end of 2023, features a distinctive orange background and ink painting style. The project was founded by four members who met on Discord, including co-founder zetman.btc, an art collector, and Joey Dodd, an artist who has collaborated with well-known companies such as DC Comics, DreamWorks Studios, Hasbro, Marvel Entertainment, and Nintendo. INK is divided into two series: INK Custom, which consists of 150 hand-drawn custom pieces, and INK Genesis, which includes 10,000 hand-drawn generated art pieces. Prior to the whitelist sale on March 28th, the price of INK NFTs was speculated to be between $4,000 and $50,000, far higher than the minting fee of 0.0058 BTC, indicating high market expectations. What sets INK apart from other Bitcoin NFT projects is that it is one of the first 10K series engraved on Legacy Sats. The concept of Legacy Sats dates back to a Bitcoin seminar in June 2022 by Ordinals founder Casey Rodarmor, six months before the launch of Ordinals. At that time, Casey distributed 41 paper wallets, each containing 10,000 Sat, with the public and private keys printed on paper. The total supply of Legacy Sats is 410,000, but nearly half have been lost, making them rarer than Uncommon Sats. In terms of brand IP building, INK has invited writer Holmes to add comic stories to the NFTs and producer @Mhelodius to create music. Additionally, the INK community is very active, with Discord members frequently organizing various creative, singing, poker, quiz, and other community events, reflecting a positive community-building culture. Data from Magic Eden shows that the floor price of INK increased nearly 14 times to 0.081 BTC within 10 hours of its launch, with a trading volume of approximately 238.4 BTC, over 6,300 holding addresses, and a current market value exceeding $56.8 million. Overall, factors such as Casey's popularity, interaction with OGs in the circle, the scarcity of Legacy Sats, and the multi-dimensional narrative of the brand have contributed to INK's rapid rise in prominence.","The Bitcoin NFT project INK experienced a significant increase in price and daily trading volume after its official launch on March 29th.

2024-03-28,"According to PANews, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is expected to approve a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in the second quarter of this year. This development could significantly change the landscape of crypto asset investments and potentially position Hong Kong as a global leader in the BTC ETF market. Noelle Acheson, a prominent figure in the crypto asset industry and author of Current Affairs, commented on the potential impact of this move, stating that the Asian crypto asset market is much larger than the US market in terms of trading volume. She outlined two possibilities: the existing high trading volume could indicate market saturation or suggest that the Asian market is more familiar with and knowledgeable about crypto assets. Acheson added that a Hong Kong-listed ETF could bring a large amount of capital into 'approved' investment portfolio allocations, implying a significant shift in investment flows. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas highlighted the importance of Hong Kong approving a spot BTC ETF with physical creation and redemption, contrasting it with the US, which only allows cash subscriptions. Balchunas said that this would help stimulate the rapidly growing asset management scale and trading volume in the region, giving Hong Kong a considerable strategic advantage. Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, also weighed in, emphasizing another key aspect of the proposed ETF structure in Hong Kong: the ability to directly extract BTC. This ensures that investors hold more than just 'paper BTC'. Long expressed excitement about this development, stating that if a spot BTC ETF is approved in Hong Kong, it would be both huge and ironic, as US banks would be left out in the cold. The discussion around the potential of a Hong Kong BTC ETF has expanded from industry experts to the broader crypto asset community. Well-known analyst Bitcoin Munger believes that the catalytic effect of a Hong Kong ETF would be much greater than that of a US ETF. Munger cited Glassnode data showing that the supply of BTC has been shifting from the West to the East year by year, and he believes this trend strengthens the case for a Hong Kong ETF surpassing a US ETF. However, not everyone is convinced that a Hong Kong ETF will have a significant impact. Eric Balchunas cautioned against overestimating the market size of Hong Kong relative to the US, stating that Hong Kong is too small compared to the US. Bitcoin Munger countered that the success of a Hong Kong ETF may not yet be fully appreciated, and any positive surprises could catch analysts, including Balchunas, off guard.",The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission is expected to approve a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in the second quarter of this year.

Source: Benjamin Cowen Crypto trader and Into The Cryptoverse founder, Benjamin Cowen, stated that the ""BTC dominance train is about to leave the station,"" indicating a belief in Bitcoin's rising dominance.

The document reveals that Runes allow Bitcoin transactions to etch, mint, and transfer native digital goods on the Bitcoin network. Although each inscription is unique, every unit of Runes is identical, making them interchangeable tokens suitable for various purposes. The Runes protocol, known as Runestones, is stored in Bitcoin transaction outputs. A transaction can have a maximum of one Runestone, which can etch a new Rune, mint an existing Rune, and transfer Runes from the transaction input to the output. Transaction outputs can carry any number of Rune balances. Runes are formed through etching, which creates a Rune and sets its attributes. Once these attributes are set, they cannot be changed, and the Rune has pre-mining capabilities. The etcher of a Rune can choose to allocate the etched Rune units to themselves, a process known as pre-mining. Runestones can be malformed for various reasons, and these malformed Runestones are called cenotaphs. Runes inputted into cenotaph transactions are destroyed. The minting in transactions with cenotaphs counts towards the minting limit, but the minted Runes are burned. Cenotaphs serve as an upgrade mechanism, allowing Runes to be given new semantics, changing the way Runes are created and transferred without misleading un-upgraded clients about the location of these Runes, as they will see the Runes as destroyed.","Casey Rodarmor, the founder of Bitcoin NFT protocol Ordinals, has announced the Rites documentation on the X platform.

2024-03-28,"According to CryptoPotato, Matt Hougan, the CIO of crypto index fund and asset management firm Bitwise, believes inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will continue for years as more investors and institutions adopt the products. Hougan shared his experiences during a 20-day road trip, where he met financial advisors who have already allocated 3% of their client’s portfolios to Bitcoin ETFs and those who have not considered the products at all, highlighting a gap in the adoption pace. Hougan also engaged with national account platforms approving Bitcoin ETF investments later this month and others looking to do so in mid-2025. He said his findings indicated that the inflows the ETF market has experienced in the past two months are not a one-time occurrence but part of long-term sustained demand. The Bitwise CIO insisted that the situation of most professional investors, who are currently unable to buy Bitcoin ETFs, would change in the next couple of years as they conduct a series of individual due diligence processes. In addition, Hougan said the ramp-up of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs would be shorter than gold ETFs, which saw inflows built over their first seven years in the market. Market analysts think the former could surpass the latter within months if high inflows persist. Hougan also claimed that 3% is the new 1% in Bitcoin investment allocation. He explained that in his six years of speaking with professional investors about Bitcoin, the talks revolved around a 1% allocation. However, that has changed, as almost every wealth market investor he met on his road trip mentioned a 3% allocation as the ideal standard. Hougan added that the primary reason for this shift is that the launch of ETFs has de-risked the downside of Bitcoin. Before, people were worried Bitcoin could go to zero, but if that possibility is off the table, 3% or 5% starts to make more sense. Meanwhile, Hougan discovered that the demand for Bitcoin ETFs from U.K. investors is far behind the surge in the U.S.",Matt Hougan is the CIO of crypto index fund and asset management firm Bitwise.

2024-03-27,"According to Cointelegraph: The Bitcoin price retracted at the $71,000 level amidst wavering confidence among professional traders. March 27 saw a moderate BTC correction to $68,430 after an unsuccessful attempt to surpass the $71,000 mark. Over the past week, Bitcoin derivatives data pointed to a decline in bullish sentiment, suggesting a break of key support at $69,000. Bitcoin's price displayed a notable rally from $63,800 to $70,000 leading up to March 27, despite only $151 million of leveraged short positions being forcibly closed on the BTC futures markets. This pattern implies skeptical bears, even after last week's considerable $888 million net withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite the pressures, Bitcoin proved resilient in its recovery from a 17.6% plunge from $73,757 on March 14 to $60,795 on March 20. Some believe the major driver for BTC reaching new heights before the upcoming April Bitcoin halving was the unexpected surge of inflows into spot ETFs. On a brighter note for Bitcoin enthusiasts, spot ETF flows saw an encouraging reversal this week, recording a total of $418 million in net inflows on March 26. Significantly, this wasn't due to reduced outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, suggesting genuine institutional demand amid Bitcoin's price lingering just 4% below its peak. Concerns related to global economic downtrends, uncertainty surrounding U.S. Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions, and increasing regulatory pressures are among the factors contributing to the weakening of Bitcoin prices. The shift away from leveraged BTC long positions, for instance, is likely a reflection of the increasing apprehension about broader economic recession threats and external pressures, such as the U.S. Justice Department's charges against KuCoin exchange recently and discussions on crypto payment limitations by the European Parliament's committee.","The Bitcoin price retracted at the $71,000 level on March 27th.

2024-03-27,"According to Cointelegraph: Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be on the brink of a supply squeeze unlike any seen before, with only about a year before demand surpasses supply, according to the latest research. In its ""Weekly Crypto Report"" on March 26, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant discussed an impending ""sell-side liquidity crisis."" The report states, ""Record Bitcoin demand paired with declining sell-side liquidity has resulted in the liquid inventory of Bitcoin plunging to the lowest ever in terms of months of demand."" The explosive demand for Bitcoin this year is largely fueled by the United States' spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and supply dynamics could entirely change by Q1 2025. CryptoQuant estimates that at the current demand growth rate, the present sell-side liquidity inventory will only suffice for the next twelve months. Notably, only accumulating addresses —those with no outgoing transactions— were included in these calculations, suggesting the actual demand might be even higher. In the analysis of Bitcoin supply strictly available on U.S. exchanges, the supply can meet demand for merely six months. Meanwhile, the liquidity crisis seems to be ""waking up"" old supply. Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant's CEO, reported on coins mined in 2010, which remained dormant until recently, making a move to a newly created wallet address. Even so, the overall trend shows Bitcoin's available supply gradually lessening, hinting at potential supply-demand imbalances in the future, which could have significant implications on BTC's market price.

2024-03-27,"According to CryptoPotato, recent projections from crypto analysts suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) could experience a significant surge, while short sellers may face considerable pressure. Analysts from the Kobeissi Letter believe that the substantial gap between institutional long positions and hedge fund shorts could lead to a massive short squeeze. Institutions are holding nearly 20,000 net long contracts compared to hedge funds' approximately 15,000 net short contracts. This margin could be the main catalyst for the BTC short squeeze, according to Kobeissi. Continued upward pressure on Bitcoin's price could force short sellers to cover their positions, further fueling the bullish momentum. A popular pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave predicts that $160K for BTC could be rather conservative. Dave bases his analysis on his own version of logarithmic growth channels (LGC), which he uses to predict market cycle tops and bottoms while filtering out short-term fluctuations and highlighting overarching trends. According to his analysis, Bitcoin appears to be following a pattern reminiscent of 2020, characterized by a breakout from an ascending channel into a parabolic upward movement, resulting in a significant price surge of approximately 154%. At press time, Bitcoin had reclaimed the $70K level, a 14.2% recovery from last week. Interest from institutions and retail investors is growing again, which could mean more bullish momentum for BTC. This comes after last week's massive outflows that pushed the cryptocurrency's price south. The asset tumbled by more than twelve grand after its most recent ATH of $73,800 to a multi-week low of under $61,000. However, BTC now stands above $70,000, and the community wonders if there will be a new ATH before the April halving.","According to the Kobeissi Letter, Bitcoin (BTC) could experience a significant surge.

This acquisition will grant them access to 24,800 bitcoins. However, the announcement did not provide details on how they would obtain the billions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency. The confusion surrounding the acquisition is exacerbated by the current financial status of both companies. Nilam Resources' company profile shows that its EBITDA is expected to be only $2 million. Xyberdata's unaudited financial statements show that its ""shareholder funds"" are about $70 million, with only $1.5 million in cash on hand.

On-chain analytics provider Glassnode attributed this to an increase in profit-taking events. The market has reached resistance with more than $2.6 billion in realized profit taken, the firm added. Glassnode observed that Bitcoin's 16% correction on March 26 was almost identical to the pre-halving pullback in the previous cycle. The majority of the 2 million BTC that switched from being 'in-profit' to being 'in-loss' during the retrace now have a cost basis above $61.2K and have recently changed hands. As the market reached its peak level, more than $2.6 billion in realized profit was locked in via on-chain spending. Around 40% of this profit-taking was attributed to long-term holders, including investors divesting from the Grayscale GBTC Trust.

However, the newly launched nine ETFs have absorbed that outflow and more. The remaining $1.56 billion in realized profit was locked in by short-term holders.

The report highlighted that since its approval on Jan. 10, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have consistently surpassed BTC “issuance by a magnitude of more than 3 times,"" exerting an upward pressure on the price. Other key components of the ongoing Bitcoin rally were healthy on-chain fundamentals, including the supply of stablecoin on exchanges. The data revealed available capital for trading, usually to buy cryptocurrencies. In contrast, a lack of intent to sell, evidenced by a decreasing supply on exchanges, supports Bitcoin's rally. The report concludes that the current market is navigating the 'mid-phase' or the 'fifth inning' of the bull run.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, programmed the year 2140 as the time when block rewards would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin. The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa. He notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009. Satoshi chose 21 million as the number of coins and distribution schedule, but the divisibility of a bitcoin could be represented differently depending on its value. As the rate of issuance declines for 132 years, transaction fees will become more important for maintaining the network's hashrate and security. Lopp is optimistic about the future of the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem, expecting on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees as the base chain starts to resemble a high-value cryptographic accumulator.",The Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply every four years.

Marathon Digital (MARA) had previously used third-party providers to host its machines rather than building its own infrastructure, but the company has changed strategy and is buying out some of the hosting services, a defensive move ahead of the halving, which Jefferies supports. The bank maintained its hold rating on Marathon Digital shares and cut its price target to $24 from $30. It increased its price target on hold-rated Argo Blockchain (ARBK) to $1.50 from $1.20 to reflect the higher bitcoin price. The bank said that with less capex dedicated to mining facility development, ARBK should have cash to buy additional miners and increase hashrate more quickly.",Bitcoin's price rose 15% in February and the network hashrate increased at a slower rate of 9%.

Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, and Bitwise’s BITB managed to climb among the top 30 ETF assets globally within their first 50 days of trading. Even Bitwise’s BITB is presently ranked 18th in assets under management, exceeding the world’s largest SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fund. On March 26, Fidelity’s fund witnessed its largest daily inflow since March 13, worth $279.1 million, adding 4,000 BTC to its holdings. This marked the firm’s second consecutive day of inflows exceeding $260 million.

2024-03-26,"According to CryptoPotato, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-seller 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad,' is a vocal proponent of Bitcoin (BTC) and a HODLer. He recently revealed plans to purchase 10 more BTC this month, worth approximately $670,000 at current rates, due to the upcoming halving event. Kiyosaki suggests that those who can't afford to buy a whole BTC should consider buying 1/10 of a coin via new ETFs or Satoshi's. He believes that if the Bitcoin process works as designed, investors may own a whole Bitcoin by the end of this year. The halving event, which occurs roughly every four years, reduces the rewards miners receive for adding new blocks to the network by half, thus slowing the production of new coins. This event has historically been followed by a massive resurgence of the entire cryptocurrency market. Kiyosaki predicts that Bitcoin's price could reach $100,000 by September this year and potentially skyrocket to $300,000 by the end of 2024. In addition to the approaching halving, other factors could contribute to a future rally for Bitcoin.

2024-03-25,"According to Cointelegraph: With eyes on the horizon for Bitcoin's upcoming halving, traders are striving to navigate the crypto market's unpredictable landscape. Bitcoin recently threw investors for a loop, dropping from $69,000 to $60,800 - approximating an 18% decline from this month's historic high of $73,800. This decrease was powered, in part, by outflows from 11 newly minted Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which shed a total of $836 million in funding between March 18-21, per data compiled by Farside Investors. Speculation mounts on whether new investors are having second thoughts and whether they are likely to hold onto Bitcoin if the downward momentum persists. Three investors were approached for insights and trading advice in today's market environment. Firstly, Lucas Kiely, Chief Investment Officer for Yield App, pointed out that since the ETFs' inception, Bitcoin has been mimicking equity markets. Kiely recommends taking advantage of liquidity surges during specific times of the day when price action is practically inevitable. However, note that outside these time windows, liquidity decreases, and price fluctuations can become severe. Michael van de Poppe, CEO and founder of MN Trading Consultancy, attributes the recent ETF investment decline partly to the most recent Federal Reserve meeting and the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates. His advice would be to buy Bitcoin dips when the price is relatively low. Lastly, Chris Newhouse, a DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs, advises today’s buyers to be cautious: distinguish between FOMO-led purchasing and long-term demand. Newhouse favors placing ""stink bids"" during weeks featuring ""wicky"" price action. The market is set to buy dips currently, but he cautions that major headwinds would be necessary for a more significant pullback. It's key to remember that, in the face of imminent halving and the volatile nature of the current market, all trading involves risk and should be undertaken with due diligence.","Bitcoin has recently dropped from $69,000 to $60,800.

Despite underperforming in recent months, investors can remain optimistic due to significant support levels. Technical analysis by TradingRage shows that against USDT, the XRP price has been steadily declining since failing to break through the $0.7 resistance level. However, support has been found around $0.6, preventing further drops. If this mark fails, there's potential for a turnaround near the 200-day moving average, situated around $0.57, offering another possible support level for XRP. A rebound from this level could lead to a potential rise toward $0.7. Examining the Bitcoin pair, there's been a prolonged downward trend in the market.

The 10 spot bitcoin ETFs saw $888 million leave across five days, as per BitMEX Research data, marking a first for the so far successful arena. This outflow was notably large on March 19 and 20, reporting $326 million and $262 million, respectively. Although net outflows slowed towards the latter part of the week, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its lowest ever daily flow total of $19 million on Friday. Despite the outflow, both the IBIT and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have notably registered net inflows for each of their first 50 days trading - a record among new ETFs.

Weighing in on the matter, James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, suggested that the recent price correction likely caused investor hesitation, resulting in lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US. Focusing on Grayscale Investments, which converted its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF on January 11, outflows there reached about $2 billion. These outflows were not entirely offset by the other nine funds, which collectively accounted for approximately $1.1 billion net inflows.

2024-03-25,"According to Cointelegraph: The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 could present a promising bull-run scenario as the event historically leads to some retracement in the token's price. This time around, experts are considering whether the presence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which could attract substantial institutional investments, might soften the downturn generally associated with halving events. Bitcoin held by funds over the last six months. Source: ByteTree Bitcoin's halving event, occurring every four years or every 210,000 blocks, reduces the supply of new BTC, maintaining the currency's intrinsic scarcity. Crypto analysis firm Rekt Capital suggests the halving process comprises five stages—pre-halving downside, pre-halving rally, pre-halving retracement, reaccumulation, and parabolic uptrend. Currently, market watchers believe Bitcoin has entered the third stage, a pre-halving retracement, where downward price movement is common as investors anticipate sell pressure and exit their positions. Bitcoin ETFs are expected to play a key role in this stage. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, a decision that expanded the exposure of the flagship digital currency to more traditional investors. On March 5, Bitcoin ETF products reached a cumulative $10 billion in trading volume, revealing a substantial demand which could counteract the price drop during the third and fourth halving stages. However, some experts argue that while Bitcoin ETF inflows could balance against the sell-off pressure, they could also amplify the effect if the demand for Bitcoin ETFs declines.

2024-03-25,"According to Cointelegraph: As the cryptocurrency world anticipates the Bitcoin halving slated for April 2024, the spotlight is on the potential implications, particularly for Bitcoin's price and network security. In this event, the reward for mining Bitcoin will be slashed by 50% in an anti-inflationary measure known as “the halving.” Historical contexts of Bitcoin halvings highlight substantial surges in its price post-halving. For instance: 1. First Halving (Nov 28, 2012): The initial reward of 50 BTC per block was cut to 25 BTC. Bitcoin's price then shot up from $12.20 to around $1,000 by the end of 2023. 2. Second Halving (July 9, 2016): The mining reward reduced to 12.5 BTC per block. Bitcoin's price rose from $640 to $2,550 within a year. 3. Third Halving (May 11, 2020): Mining rewards decreased to 6.25 BTC/block. Within a year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of about $62,000. According to this trend, Bitcoin prices have typically surged within a year post-halving, though some recessions have been recorded within that timeframe. Given this background, diverse predictions are flying around for the 2024 post-halving price, ranging from around $75,000 shortly after the event to over $250,000 within a year of the halving. Security concerns related to the upcoming Bitcoin halving stem from the potential risk to minor miners, who could be forced out due to reduced rewards.

2024-03-23,"According to CryptoPotato, Argentinians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a refuge in the face of relentless inflation and economic instability. Recent data indicates a surge in purchases of the cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable rally in recent months, hitting record highs and outpacing traditional hedges against inflation, such as the U.S. dollar. In the first week of March alone, the number of weekly Bitcoin purchases in Argentina soared to 34,700, marking the highest volume seen in the country in 20 months. This surge represents more than double the levels observed in early February, showing Argentinians’ growing interest and adoption of Bitcoin. The appeal of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation has intensified as the cryptocurrency has witnessed substantial gains, rising as much as 73% year-to-date and reaching an all-time high of over $73,000. Argentina’s inflation rate, currently at 276%, has eroded the value of the national currency, the peso, prompting citizens to seek alternative stores of value. Traditionally, the U.S. dollar has been the preferred choice for Argentinians seeking stability amidst economic turmoil. However, the recent strengthening of the peso, coupled with government efforts to stabilize the currency, has diminished the appeal of the greenback. President Javier Milei’s administration has taken steps to address economic challenges, including efforts to clean up the central bank’s balance sheet. While Milei had campaigned on a promise to dollarize Argentina’s economy, his approach since taking office has focused on managing the peso’s valuation rather than immediate dollarization. He has also suggested that full dollarization remains a distant prospect. The shift towards Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty has also led to a decline in demand for traditional assets, including digital tokens tied to real-world currencies such as USDT and USDC. Argentina has a history of economic instability, marked by frequent devaluation of its currency, which poses challenges for its residents in saving and managing finances. This has increased interest in cryptocurrency in the country, driven by the desire to avoid the effects of peso devaluation, high inflation, and limitations on accessing foreign currencies.","Argentinians are turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.

2024-03-22,"According to CoinDesk, JPMorgan has stated that bitcoin remains overbought, even after the recent sharp correction in the cryptocurrency market. The price of bitcoin fell by over 15% before rebounding following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday. In a research report, the bank noted that there is still considerable optimism in the market for prices to rise significantly by year-end, with a significant component of that optimism arising from the view that bitcoin demand via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would continue at the same pace even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes after the halving event. The quadrennial reward halving, when miners' rewards are cut in half, is expected to occur in mid-April. However, JPMorgan observed that the pace of net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs has slowed considerably, with a significant outflow recorded in the past week. This challenges the notion that the spot bitcoin ETF flow picture will be characterized as a sustained one-way net inflow.

2024-03-22,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin's next halving event is anticipated to take place in the second half of April, but the exact date remains uncertain. Block reward halvings reduce the supply of new bitcoin by 50% and are considered catalysts for price growth and a foundation for BTC's perceived four-year market cycles. Halvings do not affect the overall difficulty of bitcoin mining, but they do reduce the reward, effectively doubling the cost of bitcoin production. The specific time and date for halvings are impossible to pinpoint due to the random nature of bitcoin mining. Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin's issuance to be cut in half every 210,000 blocks, with protocols ensuring blocks are found every 10 minutes on average. It takes approximately 2.1 million minutes to mine 210,000 blocks, which translates to around four years. Miners use specialized machines, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), capable of producing trillions of hashes per second. The rate of block discovery is influenced by the global block difficulty, which is adjusted every 2,016 blocks. The difficulty is increased or decreased based on the time it took to discover the previous 2,016 blocks. Due to the stochastic process of finding blocks and the unpredictable nature of block production, it is not feasible to know when the next block or halving will occur. However, the upcoming halving event is expected to happen soon, and its impact on the market will be closely monitored.",Bitcoin's next halving event is expected to take place in the second half of April.

In addition to its cryptocurrency endeavors, El Salvador has eliminated income tax for international investments and money transfers, cutting the tax rate from 30% to 0%. This move is designed to attract foreign investors and boost economic growth. The country's commitment to bitcoin was further highlighted as it transferred more than 5,000 BTC into a cold wallet, with $400 million worth of bitcoin moved to an offline device stored in a physical vault within the nation's territory.

2024-03-21,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market have recovered, wiping out most of the losses incurred during the recent correction. The leading asset could see more positive returns in the near future, according to the latest data. Santiment's recent analysis of Bitcoin's network activity revealed a notable decline in the number of total non-zero coin wallets over the past 10 days, with a net difference of -311K. The blockchain intelligence platform said that historically, such declines have coincided with moments of FUD in the market. During these periods, small BTC wallets capitulate while larger addresses accumulate more. Taking into account these past occurrences, during similar drops in active wallets, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant price surges. For instance, from September 23rd to October 23rd, despite a decrease of 1.10 million non-zero wallets, BTC soared by 28%. Similarly, from January 21st to February 13th, with a decline of 757K non-zero wallets, BTC surged by 24%, Santiment observed. Therefore, despite the recent decrease in non-zero wallets, history suggests that Bitcoin may soon rebound with positive returns as traders exit the market, believing the top has been reached. Bitcoin saw a significant sell-off leading up to the correction that triggered a fall close to $62,000. While the crypto asset is still down nearly 10% from its recently established all-time high of $73,750, there's a renewed risk appetite among investors, particularly after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 20, as noted by QCP Capital.

2024-03-21,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has recently experienced a pullback below the $70K level, leaving market participants wondering whether the top is in or not. However, there are still several support levels available to hold the market from further decline. On the daily chart, the price has been rallying consistently since rebounding from the $40K level, but the market has recently retreated from the $75K resistance level. The $67K – $69K level is currently being tested, and if the market breaks back above, a bullish continuation would be probable. However, a rejection can lead to a drop toward the $60K and possibly lower. Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price has been declining inside a descending channel. Yet, the market has finally broken the higher boundary of the channel and is currently testing the $67K – $69K zone. If the level breaks, a rise toward the previous high of around $74K and beyond would be imminent. Meanwhile, if the price drops back inside the channel, things might go ugly as it would indicate a fake breakout and result in a drop back to the $60K level in the short term. Bitcoin's price has recently experienced a pullback, dropping below the $70K mark. Analyzing whether this correction has caused the futures market to cool down would be beneficial for investors. Bitcoin funding rates, which measure whether the buyers or sellers are executing their orders more aggressively, have been experiencing a drop recently.

2024-03-20,"According to CoinDesk, the Bitcoin blockchain has experienced a recent surge in computing power, speeding up the creation of new blocks as mining companies seek to capitalize on bullish market trends. Miners are bringing new, more powerful rigs online and even plugging in older machines again, pushing up the network computational power known as the 'hashrate.' A similar dynamic played out four years ago in the months before the last halving, which came earlier than expected. The crypto world is eagerly awaiting next month's bitcoin 'halving' – the once-every-four-years event when the reward for adding new data blocks to the network is reduced by 50%. It's a natural, pre-programmed part of the blockchain's underlying code. The halving is currently looking likely to fall around April 15, according to Nicehash's countdown. Just a few months ago, it was supposed to come on April 28. A similar phenomenon was observed in the run-up to the last halving four years ago, and history appears to be repeating itself. The halving is considered a momentous event by many, seen as a catalyst for bull runs in the bitcoin (BTC) price and certainly a talking point in this year's runup to an all-time high just over $69,000. As the theory goes, if fewer new bitcoins are being created and demand keeps surging, they're harder to come by, so the value of those already in existence increases. April's halving will see the block reward reduce to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. But there's another dynamic playing out in the bitcoin market: As the price of the cryptocurrency rises, the rewards of mining it get richer, and more operators are encouraged to turn on their machines or ramp up their computational power, known as 'hashrate.' A recent surge in hashrate has sped up the creation of new blocks as mining companies seek to cash in, and they've pushed even harder by bringing newer, more powerful equipment online. Not so long ago, the Bitcoin mining-machine maker Antminer's S19s were all the rage. Now the S21s are the top of the line.","The Bitcoin blockchain has experienced a recent surge in computing power, speeding up the creation of new blocks.

2024-03-20,"According to PANews, approximately $533 million worth of crypto long-term contracts were liquidated as Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $63,000 level. Since reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $73,800, BTC's fate has changed, with the digital asset now showing a bearish trend. In the past 24 hours, BTC continued its recent decline, with its price falling by more than 7%. For the first time in weeks, BTC dropped to the $62,600 level, meaning that its decline has exceeded 15% since its ATH. Although BTC's performance in the past day was not good, the average performance of other assets in the industry was even worse, with some assets experiencing double-digit losses. Due to these fluctuations, the derivatives market also experienced turbulence, with liquidations piling up on various exchanges. A contract is said to be ""liquidated"" when its accumulated losses reach a certain level, causing its open platform to intervene and forcibly close the contract. According to CoinGlass data, several such liquidations occurred in the crypto asset field within the past 24 hours. It appears that nearly $657 million worth of crypto asset derivative contracts were liquidated during this time. Given today's market price trend is heavily biased towards the downside, it is not surprising that the majority of liquidations involved long-term contracts. More specifically, the long market experienced $533 million in liquidations, while the short market suffered a $123 million hit. Over 80% of liquidations involved those who bet on BTC's rise. In terms of single liquidation amounts, BTC and Ethereum (ETH) once again topped the list, with liquidation amounts of $191 million and $134 million, respectively. Among other assets, Solana and Dogecoin stood out with liquidation amounts of $39 million and $14 million, respectively. The large-scale liquidation of these assets may be partly due to their larger declines compared to other well-known assets. Despite the large amount of liquidations, BTC's open interest remains at relatively extreme levels. Open interest measures the total number of contracts related to BTC in the derivatives market. Generally, when this indicator is high, BTC is more prone to fluctuations, so the sharp price swings may continue until the indicator cools down further.","$533 million worth of crypto long-term contracts were liquidated as Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $63,000 level in the past 24 hours.

2024-03-18,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin has broken its historical trend by reaching an all-time high ahead of its upcoming halving. Historically, every Bitcoin halving has come a year or two before a new all-time high. This is partly because a halving reduces the block reward paid to miners, making Bitcoin more scarce. The three previous Bitcoin halvings occurred in the run-up to an all-time high, which then gave way to a price drawdown until the next halving helped ignite another rally. For the first time in its history, Bitcoin set an all-time price high in the immediate run-up to the halving when it topped $70,000 this month. Blockworks examined how Bitcoin's price responded to prior halvings. The first halving in November 2012 saw Bitcoin's price jump from around $12 to $229 by April 2013, and then to roughly $1,132 by November 2013. After the second halving in July 2016, Bitcoin's price gradually rose for a few months before picking up momentum in May 2017, hitting a new high of roughly $19,188 in December 2017. By the third halving in May 2020, Bitcoin's price rose from around $8,500 to over $40,000 by January 2021, and then topped $63,000 in April before peaking above $67,000 in November 2021. With the next halving in April 2024, it remains to be seen whether the trend of price runs following halvings will continue, as the circumstances are noticeably different this time around. Bitcoin's ongoing bull run to an all-time high above $73,000 is uncharted territory for halvings, which previously came with Bitcoin's price far below its prior peak.","Bitcoin's price reached an all-time high in the run-up to its upcoming halving.

2024-03-17,"According to Bloomberg, the launch of Bitcoin ETF in the US earlier this year has attracted institutional investors and new fund flows, said Teng at an event in Bangkok. He added that the cryptocurrency market is just getting started. Teng had previously estimated that Bitcoin would end the year at around $80,000, but now sees it exceeding that value due to reduced supply and continued demand. He emphasized that this forecast is his personal view and that the rally won't be a straight line, with ups and downs being beneficial for the market. The world's largest cryptocurrency has surged 56% this year, reaching an all-time high of almost $73,798 last week. This rally has sparked concerns of a bubble among some investors, leading to volatility and selloffs in recent sessions. Since the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, there have been relentless inflows into these funds. Teng expects more endowments and family offices to increase allocations into Bitcoin ETFs in the near term.","The launch of Bitcoin ETF in the US earlier this year has attracted institutional investors and new fund flows.

2024-03-15,"According to CryptoPotato, renowned American author and businessman Robert Kiyosaki has once again expressed his support for Bitcoin (BTC), praising its superiority over traditional assets like gold, silver, and oil. In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki elaborated on why he believes Bitcoin stands out among these assets. He acknowledged his ownership of gold and silver mines along with oil wells, but pointed out a fundamental flaw in these traditional assets. The more they are mined, the more their values are diluted, unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. Kiyosaki’s long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin is well-known, with him consistently advising people to accumulate the cryptocurrency. Recently, he projected that Bitcoin could surge to $300,000 by the end of 2024, showing his optimism about its future prospects. Supporting Kiyosaki’s views, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, recently claimed in a CNBC interview that Bitcoin would ‘eat gold’ in the coming months. Saylor dubbed Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ citing its superiority over the precious metal due to its remarkable qualities.

2024-03-14,"The CEO of 10X Research, Markus Thielen, has published a bullish forecast for Bitcoin that suggests the digital gold may reach $77,000 in early April, and $146,000 within the next 90 days. This prediction is based on historic trends and the theory of diminishing returns. According to Thielen, Bitcoin, after hitting a new high, typically undergoes a consolidation period of 10 to 20 days, after which the price continues to rise. Thielen's analysis predicts that Bitcoin could very well reach $99,000 in May 2024. The analysis also outlines a long-term target of $125,000 for Bitcoin, a figure derived from June 2023 and November 2023 predictions. By mid-summer, Thielen posits that Bitcoin could likely reach $146,000, representing an almost 114% growth from the current price of around $68,300. A key driver in this bull market, according to Thielen, is the imbalance in supply and demand of Bitcoin spot ETFs, contributing to the coin's price surge. A notable point Thielen raised is that dips in the Bitcoin market will be actively purchased as long as ETFs continue to see inflows.   While the analysis presented by the CEO of 10X Research is optimistic, it aligns with Bitcoin's historical trend of substantial growth post-halving. This prediction adds to the growing body of bullish forecasts accentuating the dominant role Bitcoin could play in the coming months.

The fund supports education by giving students an opportunity to invest their money and channeling 25% of the investment returns to Stanford University’s financial aid.

2024-03-10,"According to CryptoPotato, Fidelity Digital Assets recently reported that while Bitcoin (BTC) holders typically expect the quadrennial reward halving to boost prices, miners must actively strategize to plan for the upcoming event to prevent going bankrupt. The halving event, expected on or around April 19, will reduce miners' earned Bitcoin by 50%. Analyst Daniel Gray states that miners must sustain their current hash rate, energy consumption, and infrastructure while facing ongoing competition from the entire network, all striving to maintain profitability amidst the same challenges. Miners must be proactive rather than merely maintaining their position within the network if they are to profit. Gray highlights that miners must continually strive to increase their hashrate efficiency, secure lower-cost energy from more economical sources, and expand their infrastructure to accommodate new machines. However, given the competitive landscape, every miner vies for the same resources. Fidelity notes that the period following the halving poses significant challenges as Bitcoin adjusts to the immediate reduction in rewards, necessitating miners to possess capital reserves to cushion the decline in revenue. Nonetheless, the report suggests that new layers could introduce fresh use cases and attract more users as the protocol evolves. Despite the historical trend of weaker miners exiting the market post-halving, the industry has consistently rebounded with increased miner participation and hashrate, showing the resilience of both the network and the industry. Notably, previous halvings in 2012 and 2016 saw the hashrate dip temporarily before rebounding. While Bitcoin’s recent surge to over $69,000 has been remarkable, analysts at JPMorgan caution that the asset’s forthcoming halving event could exert downward pressure on prices, potentially leading to a dip to $42,000. According to analysts, Bitcoin’s production cost has historically been a floor for its prices. Post-halving production costs could double to approximately $53,000, which might decrease the Bitcoin network’s hashrate as fewer miners compete to produce BTC. The projected $42,000 price level is also where the analysts anticipate that Bitcoin prices will stabilize once the halving event’s euphoria subsides after April. Alessandro Cecere, head of marketing at mining pool Luxor, notes that even if the mining reward halves, miners could still maintain profitability if Bitcoin’s price reaches $100,000, maintaining their earnings over time.","The quadrennial reward halving event will reduce miners' earned Bitcoin by 50%.

2024-02-28,"According to CoinDesk: The combination of euphoric investor sentiment, high institutional buying demand, and historic growth associated with Bitcoin's (BTC) halving events have led market observers to suggest that the cryptocurrency could break its all-time high of $69,000 in March. Bitcoin halving, an event that occurs roughly every four years wherein block rewards to miners are decreased, has traditionally been associated with substantial price rallies for the crypto asset. The next halving is slated for mid-April, causing prices to trend upwards as fewer new bitcoins become available in the market under the assumption of constant or growing demand. Bryan Legend, CEO of Hectic Labs, emphasized that the anticipation of a rally, or ""FOMO,"" tends to drive increased buying activity. He noted, though, that the rally leading up to the halving event might present a prime opportunity for realizing short-term gains. Some traders expect Bitcoin to surpass its lifetime peak of $69,000 in March, citing the early success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and robust institutional demand as potential catalysts pushing the prices upward. Commenting on the matter, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, pointed out the significant trading volume of Bitcoin ETFs, which reached a new high of $3.2 billion last week, as indicative of strong bullish sentiment among institutions. Bitcoin ETFs traded a cumulative $2 billion on Tuesday, with BlackRock’s IBIT recording over $1.3 billion in daily trading volume for the second consecutive day.

2024-02-19,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin's price has surged above $52,000, with some factors suggesting even more growth in the near future. Changes in US interest rates may also impact the asset's valuation. In the past few weeks, Bitcoin has experienced a massive upward trajectory, with its price climbing over 25% on a monthly basis and surpassing the $52,500 mark for the first time in over two years. CryptoQuant reports that Bitcoin exchange outflows have recently been on the rise, indicating that investors have shifted to self-custody methods instead of relying on centralized platforms. This trend is considered bullish as it reduces the immediate selling pressure. Another factor that might play a role in a further BTC price upswing is the halving, scheduled to take place in April this year. The event will reduce the asset's pre-programmed inflation in half, as the block rewards for miners will decline to 3.125 instead of the current number of 6.25 BTC. Historically, the halving has acted as a catalyst for future price increases since it cuts the number of newly created BTC. If the demand remains the same or increases, the price should increase. The asset reached its all-time high price of almost $70,000 in November 2021, a year and a half after the previous such event. Lastly, the cryptocurrency's price might benefit from a possible pivot from the US Federal Reserve on its anti-inflationary policy. The central bank raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to combat the galloping inflation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent mass money printing, and the ongoing global conflicts, among other reasons. However, the Fed kept the benchmark untouched during its most recent FOMC meetings, hinting at rate cuts throughout 2024. High rates make borrowing money more expensive and could hamper people's interest in riskier investments like cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, lowering the benchmark could allow more individuals and entities to deal with risk-on assets by securing outside funding. A survey conducted in 2022 estimated that 21% of the participants have taken loans to invest in crypto.","Bitcoin's price has risen over 25% on a monthly basis and surpassed the $52,500 mark for the first time in over two years.

2024-02-19,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin is likely to experience a rally of over 30% in the eight weeks leading up to its reward halving, based on data from 10X Research. The fourth halving is scheduled for April 19, and Bitcoin's monthly RSI has crossed above 80, a level that has historically indicated 60-day gains of over 50%. Despite a resurgent U.S. dollar and Treasury yields, Bitcoin has performed well in recent months, reaching its highest level since late 2021. Although a price pullback is possible, the overall uptrend is expected to continue, with prices potentially surpassing the record high of $69,000 before the fourth mining reward halving. The well-known theory that Bitcoin bottoms out 12-16 months ahead of halving and experiences uptrends before and after the event has been supported by past data. In the previous three cycles centered around halving, prices surged by over 30% in the eight weeks leading up to the event, which reduces the pace of supply expansion by 50%. The upcoming halving will reduce the per-block reward from 6.5 BTC to 3.25 BTC. According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, Bitcoin rallies an average of 32% in the 60 days before halving. Based on this data, prices could trade close to the record high of $69,000 on or before halving day. Strong inflows into U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) indicate a bullish sentiment among traditional investors. These regulated ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without the hassle of storing coins. The RSI, a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements over a set period, has crossed above 80 for the first time since December. 10X Research found that 12 out of 14 previous RSI signals led to accelerated uptrends, with an average gain of 54% in the following 60 days. Thielen noted that if history is any guide, Bitcoin could rally to $74,600 based on this signal. However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and macroeconomic factors could impact trends. The current macro picture appears supportive of increased risk-taking, as the U.S. implements the most stimulative fiscal policy in years.

2024-02-15,"According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin's recent surge to $50,000 has been linked to a seasonality effect in the crypto market, as the digital asset tends to move higher in light trading around the Lunar New Year. The cryptocurrency's comeback to its highest levels in over two years is closely associated with the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last month. However, the excitement surrounding Bitcoin ETFs seems to have already diminished, with the average daily trading volume in the crypto market falling to $113 billion so far this month, down from around $149 billion in January, according to crypto trading data firm CCData. The drop in trading volume is likely due to the Chinese New Year holidays, when many people in the Asia Pacific region travel and spend time with family and friends. Bitcoin reached the $50,000 milestone on February 12, two days after the official new year began, with holiday celebrations often lasting for a week or longer. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced an increase just before or after the Lunar New Year. Light trading can exacerbate price swings in both directions, and the Chinese New Year money gifting tradition contributes to a more positive sentiment. CCData also noted that January's volume was inflated due to the Bitcoin ETF hype but still low compared to the historical average. The average daily volume has been around $198 billion since January 2021, according to Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData. However, volume during the Lunar New Year holidays has been significantly lower compared to the rest of the year, supporting the thesis that the Chinese Lunar New Year does seem to materially depress average daily volumes.","Bitcoin's recent rise to $50,000 has been linked to a seasonality effect in the crypto market.

Data from Glassnode reveals that although Bitcoin prices remain 28% below their all-time high, the number of BTC held at a loss is rapidly decreasing, with only 13% falling into this category. Since November last year, long-term holders have traded approximately 148,000 BTC, considering the behavior of GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust). This indicates a potential shift in investor actions, with some BTC being spent and profit-taking becoming more common. As the market approaches its 2021 highs, Glassnode found that the supply of Bitcoin held at levels higher than this is gradually diminishing. This shift means that a significant majority of investors and their held assets are now in a profitable position, signaling a potential transition phase where long-term holders may begin to divest some of their holdings. Leading up to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the on-chain intelligence platform observed a notable increase in speculative activity in the market. In response, many long-term holders opted to trade their BTC, either to realize profits or possibly to adjust their portfolios to include the new ETF offerings.

He added that mainstream investors are finally able to access bitcoin, driving the surge of capital in the asset class. Bitcoin is in demand because it's uncorrelated to traditional risk assets and doesn't come with exposure to any given country or company, according to Saylor. Saylor also revealed that MicroStrategy will be re-branding to a bitcoin development company, reflecting its strategy to accumulate more bitcoin and promote the growth of the Bitcoin network.

2024-02-12,"According to CryptoPotato, Mechanism Capital partner Andrew Kang has predicted that long-term Bitcoin demand flows for 2024 will be between $40 billion and $130 billion. Kang stated that there is a significant amount of global wealth and income that could potentially flow into crypto, with the global aggregate income being around $52 trillion. With current crypto ownership at approximately 10% globally, even if crypto owners allocate only 1% of their income to digital assets annually, that would still result in $52 billion flowing into the asset class per year and $150 million per day. Kang believes these estimates are conservative, as allocation is likely higher than 1% for many true believers, and business or institutional flows are not included. Additionally, major sell flows like Mt.Gox and miner emissions are dwarfed by estimated buy flows. ETF inflows are expected to further boost demand, with recent inflows exceeding even the upper bounds of estimates. The total inflow so far for all ETFs is $2.65 billion, according to Farside. Both BlackRock and Fidelity have had more than $3 billion inflows each, with BlackRock estimating an inflow of $150 billion to $200 billion over the next three years.

The Bollinger bandwidth, created by John Bollinger in the 1980s, measures the spread between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands as a percentage of the moving average. A narrow width indicates a potential big move in either direction, similar to a tightly compressed spring.

2024-01-31,"According to CryptoPotato, Bitcoin recently found support near the crucial 100-day moving average after facing a significant rejection at the $48K resistance level, leading to a slight retracement. If a pullback materializes, the most likely scenario would involve a renewed bearish leg, targeting significant support at $38K. Upon analyzing the daily chart, it becomes apparent that following Bitcoin’s recent setback from the pivotal $48K level, the price sought support around a crucial range defined by the middle boundary of the ascending channel and the significant 100-day moving average at $39K. Consequently, a slight correction ensued, retracing the price toward the existing fair value gap (FVG) bounded within the $43,578 and $45,606 thresholds. This price range carries the potential to exert resistance against further selling pressure, maybe even propelling it back toward the substantial 100-day moving average. However, a breach below this critical moving average could lay the groundwork for a mid-term bearish trend. An examination of the 4-hour chart reveals a notable dip below the lower boundary of the ascending flag, leading the price to the static support zone encompassing $39K and the significant 0.5 level of Fibonacci retracement, resulting in a noteworthy reversal. Consequently, the price experienced a bullish surge, retracing towards a critical resistance marked by the lower boundary of the ascending flag. However, Bitcoin appears to be in the process of completing a pullback to the broken flag, setting the stage for a renewed bearish phase. Therefore, in the event of a successful pullback, the market should anticipate a mid-term descent towards the $38K significant support region. Looking at the behavior of Bitcoin miners becomes particularly crucial, especially in the aftermath of the recent surge in price beyond the significant $40K threshold. Given their pivotal role in the Bitcoin network, the actions of miners can wield substantial influence over the market. The Miners’ Position Index Metric (MPI) displayed in the chart offers a representation of the ratio of total miner outflow (in USD) to its one-year moving average. A higher MPI value implies that miners are sending more coins than usual, indicating potential selling activity. The chart notably illustrates a significant uptick in MPI during Bitcoin’s recent upward movement above $40K. However, based on the MPI analysis, concerns regarding capitulation appear to be minimal. It appears that miners have already secured considerable profits, fortifying their financial positions. This resilience suggests that miners have the capacity to endure potential deeper corrections in the BTC market in the future. Nevertheless, a word of caution is warranted; if the ongoing selling behavior among miners persists, it could lead to an oversupply of Bitcoin in the market, possibly resulting in a substantial price crash.","Bitcoin has recently found support near the crucial 100-day moving average at $39K.

2024-01-31,"According to Decrypt, Bitcoin (BTC) remained stable despite the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates. While most other major cryptocurrencies experienced a drop, Bitcoin traded at over $43,471 per coin, with a movement of less than 1% in 24 hours and a nearly 9% increase over the week. The U.S. central bank decided to keep the rate policy steady for the fourth consecutive time, stating that it will not reduce the target range until it gains greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, was down 1.5% in 24 hours, priced at $2,339. Most of the top 20 digital coins and tokens experienced a dip following the news. The S&P500 dropped nearly 1% after the statement's release, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 0.1%.

2024-01-31,"According to Blockworks, net inflows into US spot bitcoin ETFs have reached over $1.2 billion, a figure expected to grow exponentially as more investment professionals allocate funds to them. However, Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, believes that the primary market for spot bitcoin ETFs, particularly the wealth management sector, needs more time before investing client capital. Thorn estimates that the wealth management sector controls $48 trillion in assets, with most of it affiliated with banks or broker-dealers that have not yet added bitcoin ETFs to their investment options. A survey conducted by Bitwise and VettaFi in late 2021 revealed that approximately 80% of financial advisers were either unable to buy crypto for clients or unsure if they could. Among those interested in adding bitcoin exposure to client portfolios, nearly 90% were waiting for a spot bitcoin ETF to be approved. Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services and the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, expects financial advisers to allocate more than $150 billion into spot bitcoin ETFs within the next two years. Ten spot bitcoin ETFs were launched on January 11, with BlackRock and Fidelity funds leading the pack with over $2 billion in net inflows each. However, outflows from Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) have tempered the sector's asset gains. Edelman predicts that BTC funds will be available on wealth manager platforms within the next six to 12 months, allowing advisers to allocate them on behalf of clients. Ryan Rasmussen, senior crypto research analyst at Bitwise, noted that some wealth managers, particularly independent registered investment advisers (RIAs), are already investing in crypto products, with allocations ranging between 1% and 5%. Rasmussen believes that if spot bitcoin ETFs captured 1% of all ETF assets in the US, it would result in more than $70 billion of assets under management in spot bitcoin ETFs, a figure he considers very reachable.",Net inflows into US spot bitcoin ETFs have reached over $1.2 billion.

2024-01-31,"According to Decrypt, Bitcoin's price movements are showing patterns similar to those seen before past bull market runs. On Wednesday morning in Europe, Bitcoin was trading for around $42,560, a 2.3% drop from the same time yesterday, but 6% higher than the BTC price a week ago. The narrative around prices at the start of the week was that Bitcoin was starting to gain on expectations that U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell might drop hints about lowering interest rates later this year when he announces the Fed's rates later today. However, that optimism evaporated, and prices slid with it. Analysts at Glassnode, in their latest Insights blog post, noted that the current cycle remains marginally ahead of both the 2016-17 and 2019-20 periods, due in part to an extremely strong year in 2023. The main headwinds have come from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) redemptions, with around 115.6k BTC being redeemed from the GBTC ETF since conversion, creating significant market headwinds.","Bitcoin's price movements are showing patterns similar to those seen before past bull market runs.

2024-01-04,"According to Blockworks, Bitcoin has recovered losses from earlier in the week, while stocks struggled to maintain their fourth quarter momentum. Analysts attribute this to uncertainty from the Federal Reserve on the pace of rate cuts in 2024 and optimism about the timeline for approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bitcoin was trading 1.5% higher over the past 24 hours Thursday morning, rebounding from the decline that saw the cryptocurrency drop as much as 8% Wednesday. Ether was also back in the green, gaining about 2% Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite headed for its fifth straight day of losses Thursday at the start of the trading session, while the S&P 500 traded sideways. The Nasdaq Composite is now down 2.3% since the start of the year, and the S&P 500 has lost 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is faring slightly better, gaining 0.3% Thursday morning and positioning it flat since the first trading day of 2024. Analysts attribute the decline to hesitation from the Fed about how many rate cuts might come in 2024 and when they could start, as demonstrated by the December Federal Open Market Committee minutes released Wednesday. Committee members signaled that three cuts could happen this year, but they remain uncertain and will determine next steps based on how the economy evolves. Fed Funds Futures still call for six 25 basis point cuts in 2024 starting in March, according to data from CME Group. Bitcoin's Wednesday decline coincided with a report from financial services firm Matrixport, which questioned the likelihood of an ETF getting the green light this month. Matrixport analysts said the US Securities and Exchange Commission decision-makers, which are dominated by Democrats, would not vote in favor of a spot bitcoin product.

2023-12-30,"According to CryptoPotato, the cryptocurrency market has not experienced a 25% drawdown in the past 12 months for 234 consecutive days, marking the longest streak since 2011. Despite altcoins surging in various directions, Bitcoin has emerged as one of the top-performing crypto assets. Data also indicates that Bitcoin currently holds the top position among blockchain networks in terms of transaction fees over the past seven days. Reflexivity's latest report reveals that the persistent increase in Bitcoin transaction fees has been significant, as it has recorded the highest cumulative numbers of any blockchain network during this period, exceeding $100 million. This surge in miner revenue acts as a powerful incentive for more operators to join the network by deploying additional machines, aiming to capture a larger share of the transaction rewards. Bitcoin's hash rate hit an all-time high of 544 exahashes per second (EH/s) on December 25, representing a 130% increase since January, when it was hovering near 253 EH/s. According to Reflexivity, this uptrend not only signifies increased energy consumption for network security but also reflects the integration of more efficient mining rigs. At the end of 2022, the crypto industry experienced a significant downturn, with Bitcoin's value plummeting to a mere $17,000. Fast forward twelve months, and Bitcoin has undergone a remarkable resurgence, with its price soaring by an astonishing 155% year-to-date. The driving force behind Bitcoin's resurgence lies in persistent speculation surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF by the SEC. This approval would mark a historic moment, enabling prominent institutional investors to enter the cryptocurrency market for the first time. The open interest in Bitcoin CME futures has once again surpassed the $5 billion mark, which could potentially indicate that the participation of traditional financial entities has put the Bitcoin ETF front running trade on. It is crucial to keep a close eye on this development, particularly considering that the CME presently holds a historically high percentage of Bitcoin's overall futures open interest. The discount on GBTC is narrowing further, currently standing at just 6% below its net asset value, which is indicative of optimistic sentiments regarding the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the early days of January.","The cryptocurrency market has not experienced a 25% drawdown in the past 12 months for 234 consecutive days.

2023-12-07,"According to Coincu, discussions between US financial regulators and applicants for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) have progressed to key technical details, signaling that the much-anticipated offering may soon become a reality. Meetings between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and investment funds seeking to list Bitcoin ETFs have accelerated in recent weeks, leading applicants to make changes to their filings based on regulators' feedback. This development comes after a federal court ruling in August that requires the SEC to reconsider Grayscale's previously rejected Bitcoin ETF application, potentially reducing the grounds for rejecting other applications. Grayscale, along with firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, is among the dozen companies that have applied for a Bitcoin ETF. This type of ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset. Experts, including Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, believe that the window for approval of a Bitcoin ETF is January 5-10, 2024, coinciding with the deadline of the application from ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood. Bitcoin has surged approximately 160% year-to-date, outperforming major stock indexes, although it remains about 35% below its late 2021 peak. This resurgence comes after a challenging 2022 for cryptocurrencies, marked by bankruptcies and financial turmoil. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be significant as it would provide investors with exposure to the largest digital asset without the need to directly trade on exchanges. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who was previously skeptical of crypto, has shown signs of warming to the idea of opening the door for wider Bitcoin investment.","US financial regulators are discussing details for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2023-05-17,"Famous Canadian psychologist and political commentator Jordan Peterson believes Bitcoin is the only “viable” monetary alternative in a future world dominated by central bank digital currency (CBDC). The intellectual recently spoke with tech expert and entrepreneur Brian Roemmele about artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, highlighting how Bitcoin can serve to shield the world from its tyrannical excesses. Using Bitcoin for Communication In an interview published on Monday, Roemmele said that he sees blockchain – specifically Bitcoin – being wrapped up into a popular payment system, due to the “way it was made.” Peterson followed up by saying that Bitcoin is the “only alternative I can see to a centralized bank digital currency,” which he predicted will be “foisted upon us at any point.” “Bitcoin actually is decentralized,” said Peterson. “It isn’t amenable to control by a bureaucracy.” As the psychologist noted how Bitcoin could, in principle, be used for “wealth storage” and as a “currency,” Roemmele added that it could also be used for “communication.” “Encrypted within a blockchain is almost an unlimited amount of data,” he said. “You can actually memorialize information that you want decentralized and never to go away.” Unlike traditional bank transfers, Bitcoin transactions that have been registered on the public blockchain for more than one hour are virtually irreversible and logged across tens of thousands of Bitcoin nodes across the world. This feature of Bitcoin has recently become popular for memorializing NFTs through the Ordinals protocol, which bakes image data directly into the public blockchain. Peterson’s Blockchain Idea Peterson noted that he’d be interested in using Bitcoin as a form of “permanent, incorruptible information storage” to develop a “blockchain corpus of general knowledge questions” for running IQ tests, and prevent people from “gerrymandering the measurement of general cognitive ability.” “You could derive random samples of general ability tests that would be 100% robust reliable and valid, and nobody could gerrymander them,” he said. “Just the way Bitcoins stops fiat currency producers from inflating the currency.” Peterson has previously praised Bitcoin as a way of combatting tyrannical control imposed by CBDCs in the past. He’s also regarded it as an inflation hedge, and bought some as an inflation shield in November 2021 – though the asset hasn’t performed well since that time. The post Jordan Peterson: Bitcoin is the Only Alternative to a CBDC appeared first on CryptoPotato.","Jordan Peterson believes Bitcoin is the only alternative to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
